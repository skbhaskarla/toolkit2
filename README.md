This repository holds the sources for the XDS Toolkit (aka Document Sharing Toolkit).  The project home page can be found at [http://ihexds.nist.gov](http://ihexds.nist.gov) and downloads are listed at [http://ihexds.nist.gov/downloads.html](http://ihexds.nist.gov/downloads.html). This project is being moved from SourceForge where it is known as IheOs. 

The focus of IheOs (toolkit) is to support testing of Document Sharing profiles defined by the IT Infrastructure Committees of IHE (see [ihe.net](ihe.net)). We host copies of toolkit along with the older Public Registry service (see [ihexds.nist.gov/links](ihexds.nist.gov/links)).
