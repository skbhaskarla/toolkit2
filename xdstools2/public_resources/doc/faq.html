<b>Q:  What certification criteria will ONC-ATCBs use to certify EHR technology for purposes of the “deeming” provision 
of the Physician Self-Referral Prohibition and Anti-Kickback Electronic Health Record (EHR) Exception and Safe Harbor Final Rules?</b>
<pre>Both the Physician Self-Referral Prohibition EHR Exception and the Anti-kickback EHR 
Safe Harbor regulations, at 42 CFR 411.357(w) and 42 CFR 1001.952(y), respectively, provide that software “is deemed to be interoperable 
if a certifying body recognized by the Secretary has certified the software within no more than 12 months prior to the date it is provided 
to the recipient.” The “recognition” of certification bodies process referred to in these regulations, as discussed in the Temporary Certification 
Program Final Rule (the Final Rule) (75 FR 36185) has been superseded or folded into the ONC-ATCB and ONC-ACB “authorization” processes. Consequently, 
the ONC-ATCB and ONC-ACB “authorization” processes will constitute the Secretary’s “recognition” of a certification body. With that said, as further 
explained in the Final Rule, ONC-ATCBs are required to test and certify EHR technology to all applicable certification criteria adopted by the Secretary 
at 45 CFR part 170, subpart C. We believe that the certification criteria adopted by the Secretary specify essential interoperability requirements and 
build the foundation for more advanced interoperability in the future. Any questions regarding compliance with the exception or safe harbor should be 
directed to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG), respectively.

<a name="isgoogleaccountrequired"> </a>
<b>Q:  Do I need a Google account to be able to use Google Groups?</b>
<pre>Yes and no, depending on how much you will be using Google Groups.

No, if you will not need to sign in to Google Groups for example to
create your own groups and if you don't need to change your Google
Groups settings (for example your <a href="#changemyname">name</a> and <a href="#changemydeliverysettings">email delivery settings</a>).

Yes, if you want to sign in to Google Groups to be able to discuss by
also using the Google Groups web interface and if you want to create
and manage your own groups and if you want to change your Google
Groups settings.

You can create a Google account associated with your email address
here: <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount">https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount</a>

<a name="howtosignin"> </a>
<b>Q:  How can I sign in to Google Groups?</b>
<pre>1.<a name="howtosigninstep1"> </a>Go to the Google Groups main page at <a href="http://groups.google.com/">http://groups.google.com/</a>. To
go to that web address with your web browser, write that address to
the address bar of your web browser and press the Enter key (or
equivalent key) on your keyboard.

2.<a name="howtosigninstep2"> </a>If you have followed <a href="#howtosigninstep1">step 1</a> and you are now on the Google Groups
main page and you see a "Sign out" link at the top of the page and you
also see an email address on the same line and if that email address
is not the email address you want to sign in to Google Groups, then
you need to <a href="#howtosignout">sign out</a> from Google Groups.

3.<a name="howtosigninstep3"> </a>If you have followed <a href="#howtosigninstep2">step 2</a> and you now see a page where your email
address and password are asked, then you need to type your email
address to the "Email" text field and your password to the "Password"
text field and press the "Sign in" button. Instead of pressing the
"Sign in" button, you may also press the Enter key (or equivalent key)
on your keyboard.

4.<a name="howtosigninstep4"> </a>You should now be signed in to Google Groups. If you are not signed
in to Google Groups, see question "<a href="#cannotsignin">Why can't I sign in to Google
Groups?</a>" below for instructions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<a name="cannotsignin"> </a>
<b>Q:  Why can't I sign in to Google Groups?</b>
<pre>When you sign in to Google Groups, use the email address you have used
so far to sign in to Google Groups. Check the email address you are
giving to Google Groups when you sign in. Check the password you are
using. Use the Google Account password for signing in to Google
Groups. If you have no Google account associated with your current
email address, then you need to create one. If you have forgotten
your Google account username and/or password, see the Google Accounts
help pages for instructions:

<a href="http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?answer=48598">http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?answer=48598</a>

If multiple people or multiple email addresses are used with the same
computer to access Google Groups, the previous user or email address
may still be signed in to Google Groups, so you need to <a href="#howtosignout">sign out</a>
first.

If you have no Google account, but you have been <u>invited</u> to a group,
you need to accept the invitation by clicking the appropriate link
in the email message you have received. Then you need to <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount">create a
Google account</a> to be able to sign in to Google Groups.

If you have no Google account, but you have been <u>added</u> to a group,
then you need to <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount">create a Google account</a> to be able to sign in to
Google Groups.

<a name="howtosignout"> </a>
<b>Q:  How can I sign out from Google Groups?</b>
<pre>When you are signed in to Google Groups, on almost any Google Groups
page there should be a "Sign out" link at the top of the page. Click
that link to sign out. Make sure you are signed out from Google Groups
by looking at the top of the page. If you still see a "Sign out" link
at the top of the page then you might have accidentally clicked a
wrong link or maybe you had multiple web browser windows open in which
case try to close all the web browser windows.

<a name="googlegroupsmainpage"> </a>
<b>Q:  How can I see the Google Groups main page?</b>
<pre>On almost any Google Groups page there should be a "<a href="http://groups.google.com/">My Groups</a>" link at
the top of the page. Click that link and you should be redirected to
<a href="http://groups.google.com/">http://groups.google.com/</a>. That page is also known as the "My Groups"
page, because you can access it with the "My Groups" link (when signed
in to Google Groups) and also because that page has the "My groups"
heading.

the "My profile" heading on your profile page. You should see seven
sections where you can change your information: "Name", "Location",
"Title", "Industry", "Website or Blog", "Quote", and "About me". If
you want to give for example more contact informations, such as your
AIM, ICQ, Jabber, MSN, Skype, Yahoo!, and other instant messenger and
chat names, you could list them on the "About me" section of your
profile. Or you could tell about them on one of your web pages (if you
have any) and then mention the URL (web address) of that web page on
the "Website or Blog" section of your profile.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<a name="cannotseesectionsorparts"> </a>
<b>Q:  Why can't I see some group sections or some parts of pages?</b>
<pre>1) If you can't see some of the group sections (discussions, pages,
files) at all, have the owner (which may be you), click on the "Group
settings" link on the right and then on "Access" to check to see if
these sections have been hidden.

2) If you can see the sections of your group but they're cut off or
falling off the page, then you may need to try the following settings
that should help you see them more easily:

Try changing the text size setting of your web browser. If you have
Internet Explorer 7 or 8 select the "Text Size" option from the "View"
menu. If you have Mozilla Firefox 3, select the "Zoom" option from the
"View" menu and. If you have Google Chrome 8, select the wrench tool
icon and look at the options next to the "Zoom" text. If you have
Safari 5, select "Zoom In" or "Zoom Out" from the "View" menu (if you
can't find the "View" menu, click the tool icon and select "Show Menu
Bar").

Try maximizing your web browser window. If you are using the
Windows operating system, left-click once the icon on the top left
hand corner of the browser and select the "Maximize" option (if you
don't see that option available, then your web browser window might
already be maximized).

Try increasing the screen resolution. If you are using the Windows
operating system, from the Control Panel, double-click the "Display"
icon, select the "Settings" tab, and adjust the screen resolution by
dragging the controller under text "Screen resolution". (You can find
the Control Panel by pressing the "Start" button and selecting
"Settings". Or you can find the "Display" window by right-clicking the
Windows Desktop and selecting "Properties" option from the pop-up menu
that appears.)

3) If none of the above helps, then try another web browser (Internet
Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, etc.) as
Google Groups have been known having different layout problems with
various web browsers.

<a name="webinterfacelanguage"> </a>
<b>Q:  How can I use a certain language setting with the Google Groups
    web interface?</b>
<pre>To change the language settings for Google and your web browser, see
this page:

<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/tomihasa/google-general-faq#changelanguage">http://sites.google.com/site/tomihasa/google-general-faq#changelanguage</a>

If you are encountering problems with your group, check the language
setting for your group from "Group settings", "Advanced", "Primary
language".

If changing the language settings for Google, your web browser and
operating system doesn't help, then it's probably a bug in Google
Groups, but you should be able to force Google Groups to use a certain
language by defining the web interface language by adding ?hl=xx
(where xx is the language code) to the current URL (web address) in
the address bar of your web browser. For example, if you are on the
below Google Groups page:

   http://groups.google.com/grphp?

and you want to use the English language, try adding hl=en to the end
of the URL (and press Enter or equivalent key):

   http://groups.google.com/grphp?hl=en

See the below page for a list of some of the language codes you can
use with Google:
