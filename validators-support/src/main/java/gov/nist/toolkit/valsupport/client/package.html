<h2>Code shared between backend and GWT frontend</h2>

<p>Code in this directory is used by both the server and the GWT-based
graphical front end.  It must be isolated in its own directory 
because declarations to the GWT cross-compiler are based on
directories.  The file common2/common2.gwt.xml is the config
file that guides the cross-compiler.
