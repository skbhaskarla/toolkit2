Certificate formats and utilities

**********************  DER   (Public Key)

openssl x509 -inform DER -text -in hit-testing.nist.gov.der

grep for line containing Subject:   and    CN=
value of CN is domain name
   
raw input line looks like:
        Subject: emailAddress=hit-testing.nist.gov, CN=hit-testing.nist.gov, C=USA, ST=MD, L=Gaithersburg, O=hit-testing.nist.gov


public key - grep for "Public Key Algorithm"

DNS: domain-name can be used


********************     P12 (private key)

openssl pkcs12 -in hit-testing.nist.gov.p12 -nokeys -password pass:

if password not empty then -password file:password may work (haven't tested)

key line of output is 
subject=/emailAddress=hit-testing.nist.gov/CN=hit-testing.nist.gov/C=USA/ST=MD/L=Gaithersburg/O=hit-testing.nist.gov

looks like CN is key entry

if pass in garbage file instead of p12 then error looks like
14501:error:0D07207B:asn1 encoding routines:ASN1_get_object:header too long:/SourceCache/OpenSSL098/OpenSSL098-44/src/crypto/asn1/asn1_lib.c:150:
