Some Connectathon notes

The config param is blank by default forcing the use of actors.xml 
instead of actors/.  The value of this field for Euro 2011 was
http://gazelle.ihe.net/EU-CAT/systemConfigurations.seam?testingSessionId=15
The value for na20132 was 
http://ihe.wustl.edu/gazelle-na/systemConfigurations.seam?testingSessionId=23
Each season it may be necessary to ask Eric for a new value.  The EU-CAT
part and testingSessionId are probably the only things that change.

To build an actors config for Connectathon:

1) Go to the OID Management page in Gazelle.  At the bottom left is a link 'Export as Excel file'.

2) Once downloaded (filename will be oidSummary.xls), use Excel to generate a CSV file. Name should be oidSummary.csv

3) Create new actors directory under $external_cache$/actors and put oidSummary.csv there.

4) Enter the aboe testingSessionId URL into the toolkit at the bottom of the [Toolkit Configuration] tab.

5) The id will have to be adjusted.  For CAT-2012 the value is 21.  I can find no page in Gazelle that
offers this value.  I had to use email and ask.

6) Hit the Load all Gazelle Configs button.  There can be a significant delay.  A popup will appear with either
an error message or the number of configs downloaded.

7) The actors directory is now populated with the configs.
