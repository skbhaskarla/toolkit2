<h1>TTT Configuration Requirements</h1>

<h2>Overview of configuration issues and requirement<h2>
<p>This section describes the overall architecture of TTT and shows the necessary configuration elements.

<p>TTT is composed of two main elements: the toolkit and the listener.  The toolkit has been distributed in
the support of testing within the industrial organization Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) for many 
years. The same toolkit is used within TTT but with additional tools present which are relevant to Direct and
other elements of Meaningful Use. 

<p>The toolkit is Web ARchive file suitable for installation on top of a Servlet platform like Tomcat.
In its IHE use, it is distributed as a WAR file for local installation. For use within TTT there are 
additional parts and configurations.

<p>The second part of TTT is the listener/daemon which listens on port 25 for incoming SMTP messages. This
listener includes the capability of validating the Direct/SMTP messages against the estabished specifications,
storing information about the messages and generating a validation report.  The efforts of the listener
and the toolkit are coordinated through the use of shared files.

<p>While the toolkit has been successfully used on Windows platforms, the listener requires a Unix-based platform.
As distributed in its VMware appliance, it is installed on top of Ubuntu Linux.

<p>The third element of TTT, also part of the more basic toolkit, is the External Cache.  This is directory separate
from the servlet container or listener where configurations and log informtion is stored. It is established 
in a separate location so that installation of new versions of toolkit or listener do not disturb its contents.
The primary configuration element stored within toolkit and listener (which must be updated with each installation/upgrade)
is the location of this external cache.

<h2>Configuration files</h2>

<p>The primary configuration file resides in toolkit at WEB-INF/toolkit.properties.  This is usually modified
using the built in editor within toolkit. The editor is found on the Home page of toolkit at the top.  The
link is labeled <i>Toolkit Configuration</i>. This editor is protected by a password, default value is <i>easy</i>.

<p>Most of the properties edited here have not yet been described, they are documented here lightly for completeness.
<p>External_Cache - location of the external cache.  This path may not contain any spaces, tabs or non-printing characters.
<p>Admin_password - easy enough
<p>Toolkit_Host, Toolkit_Port, Toolkit_TLS_Port describe the installation characteristics of the toolkit and are relevant
when SOAP messages are being sent to toolkit.  The overall facility for accepting outside SOAP messages to toolkit is called 
Simulators.
<p>Default_Environment - name of the configuration used, by default, to define the certificates used in outgoing TLS
protected SOAP messages. It also contains the Affinity Domain configuration file used by the IHE XDS profile. 
<p>Enable_all_cyphers, Use_Actors_File and Gazelle_Config_URL - must be left with their default values.  It is 
especially important that Gazelle_Config_URL be left blank or SOAP configuration editing will be disabled.

<h2>Elements of the External Cache</h2>

<p>The external cache contains files and directory structures that control and/or record activities of the toolkit and
listener. They are organized here roughly based on whether they support the basic toolkit (SOAP) or Direct (SMTP).

<h3>SOAP based protocols</h3>
<p>actors.xml - SOAP endpoints and related parameters 
<p>environment - each named sub-directory defines the TLS certificates and metadata coding requirements governing 
SOAP based interactions
<p>TestLogCache - log files from SOAP based interactions
<p>simdb - configuration information and log files for SOAP based simulators (accept incoming SOAP transactions)

<h3>Direct support</h3>
<p>tk_props.txt - configuration information for Direct screens and functionality
<p>direct/contact - storage for information on contact email addresses related to the Direct Registration panel
<p>direct/encrypt_certs - public certs used for message encryption based on DNS domain name - must be in DER format
<p>direct/signing_cert -  cert including private key for the DNS domain the toolkit is operating in currently.  Must be in p12 format. 
Separate file password.txt contains the certificate file password.

<h2>Configuration requirements</h2>

<h3>Configurations necessary for the virtual machine deployment</h3>

<p>These steps must be performed even when installing virtual machine version of TTT

<ol>
<li>Assign DNS domain 
  <ul>
    <li>Register domain
    <li>Establish MX records etc. in DNS environment
    <li>Update tk_props.txt configuration file
      <ul>
      	<li>SMPT server for sending validation reports
      	<li>Validation report message format (local installation can have customized wording)
      	<li>Direct (To) addresses for triggering CCDA validation
      	<li>DNS domain where toolkit is installed
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Create and install encryption cert tied to this domain
    <li>Create and install trust anchor tied to this domain (or find existing trust anchor is this site is covered within
        its namespace)
    <li>Create and install signing cert tied to this domain
    <li>Configure Ubuntu Linux (under VMWare) with hostname/IP address taken from this DNS domain
    <li>Establish configuration for DNS servers
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Create and install certificate for TLS (assuming use of SOAP elements of toolkit) 
</ol>
