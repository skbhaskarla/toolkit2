xdstest2 testing tool change log

Version 1.0 
Oct 29, 2007
Initial release

Version 1.1

Schema validation routines looked to localhost for schema file.  Change this so 
it looks to Public Registry server for these files.

Added command line arguments to log file.

Repaired operation of test 11710. It was returning failure when it had been
successful.

Version 1.2

Fixed operation of --prepare command line option.  The ProvideAndRegister transaction was ignoring this option.

---------------------------------------------------------

xdstest2 was generating XOP format (using mime attachments) even though only metadata was transported. This 
has been fixed so that the message is a simple SOAP Envelope.

Fixed the shared schema reference libraries so they reference schema files correctly both on the server (localhost)
and within xdstest2 (network reference to server). 

to be released as Version 1.13

---------------------------------------------------------

Above shared schema fix was wrong.  This time I was able to test it properly.

released as version 1.14

---------------------------------------------------------

Problem running test 11982 where metadata is sent but normal document
attachment is missing. Tool was sending header
	Content-Type: type="text/xml"
which is not valid http, although
	Content-Length: multipart/related; boundary=MIMEBoundaryurn_uuid_30615C45AB8F5F79FF1200322399377; type="text/xml"
is valid.  It has been corrected it to 
	Content-Type: "text/xml"

Fixed HTTP header for Provide and Register.a request.  It was missing a LF in
the normal CRLF end of line markers. Specifically, the missing LF was on 
the blank line separating the headers from the body.

released as version 1.17
---------------------------------------------------------

New file in mgmt subdirectory, default.xml.  This file will hold all default parameter values in the future. For now
it holds a new parameter, HomeCommunityId which is used by the new XCA tests.

released as version 1.19
---------------------------------------------------------

Fixed WS:Action values generated (and accepted) for XCA transactions.

released as version 1.20
---------------------------------------------------------

Enabled <SOAP11/> to be selected for Retrieve

released as version 1.21
---------------------------------------------------------

SOAP11 result was not being passed on to the low level retrieve logic.

released as version 1.22
---------------------------------------------------------

Schema validation from xdstest2 now references schemas on server on port 80. This helps
with corporate firewalls.

released as version 1.23
---------------------------------------------------------

Fixed validation of home attribute on XGQ transaction.

Log file now shows SOAP with Attachments faults
