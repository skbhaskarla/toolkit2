<h1>Simulator Architecture</h1>

<p>This page documents the evolving architecture for creating
simulators.  By adding some regularity into the structure
hopefully some reusable pieces will evolve.

<p>First is the two layer structure. The top layer is an actor
simulator. The bottom layer is a transaction simulator.  Each of these
is labeled and supported by a base class.  Actor simulators are based on
the abstract class ActorSimulator.  Transaction Simulators are based on
the abstract class TransactionSimulator. Each of these base classes
control the arguments of the run() method.  Flexibility in creating
new simulators comes in arguments to the constructor.

<p>Actor simulator classes' run method take transactionType, 
MessageValidatorEngine, and validation as arguments. 
The MessageValidationEngine is of course the underlying execution engine and
task scheduler.  The validation is a string which is decoded as a request
for special validations.  Its value comes straight from the endpoint.
This way special validations, such as a submit containing a particular
metadata pattern, can be requested. The actor simulator is the only enforcer
of format for this string.

<p>Actor simulator class contructors most likely include SimCommon, SimDb, the
ActorSimulatorConfig, and HttpServletResponse.

<p>The run method is structured as a switch statement, one case for each
transaction. Processing starts by initializing the ValidationContext and
running the initial validations via common.runInitialValidations() followed
by a call to mvc.hasErrors() which determines whether any error are present
that should be reported via SOAPFault.  After this point all errors
are reported via protocol message responses.

<p>An instance of the transaction class is created and scheduled for 
execution via mvc.addMessageValidator().  Transaction classes are based 
on the message validation architecture and rely on that scheduler, found
in the MessageValidationEngine. Actor classes do not rely on the
MessageValidationEngine.

<p>Another distinction between actor and transaction classes is that
actor classes are responsible for packaging the response in a SOAP wrapper.
Overall:
<ul>
<li>Some utility type functionality is packaged as simulators
<li>They extend the class TransactionSimulator
<li>They are run using the MessageValidationEngine scheduler
<li>These simulators can be organized as actor supporting or 
transaction supporting 
</ul>
