# Release Notes for release 2.202.7 #

FIXED - The XDS-I work introduced a bug in the SIMPLE SOAP response message.  A spurrious MIME Boundary string was appended
to the end of the message.  

FIXED - Metadata handling - XML namespace issue.Â  When wrapper element and wrapped element both set namespace the 
XML dup function (uses OMFormatter) does not replicate namespace correctly. This bug showed up when the 
metadata wrapper element (SubmitObjectsRequest) and the inner wrapper element (RegistryObjectList) both contain 
namespace local definitions (rim:). The result was all children of RegistryObjectList being placed in the 
default namespace instead of rim:.

FIXED - hash calculation error in the Repository simulator.  The error only occurred when the document size was
greater then 4k characters.  This was a buffer management problem.

FEATURE - added the XDM validator to the API.

FEATURE - added ability to request TLS transmission from API.
 
FEATURE - added test tools for Initiating Gateway and Responding Gateway.
