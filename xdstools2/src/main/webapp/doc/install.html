<h1>Toolkit Installation</h1>

<b>These instructions are appropriate for the IHE version of the tool, called xdstools2. Other versions
now exist and the downloads may be made from other web locations.</b>

<p>Release notes are available from <a href="release_notes.html">here</a>.

<p>This tool is downloadable from 
<a href="http://ihexds.nist.gov/XdsDocs/xdstoolkitgui/">http://ihexds.nist.gov/XdsDocs/xdstoolkitgui/</a>. 
Always grab the latest release.

<ol>
<li>Choose a Servlet container to run the toolkit. It is known to run well in the following 
Servlet containers:
<ul>
<li>Tomcat versions 5.5.*
<li>JBoss version 4.2.3
</ul>

<p><b>The directory you choose for Tomcat installation is critical.  If there is a space character in the path
then parts of the toolkit will not work.  This software was built on a Unix platform and not Windows.  Installing
under Program Files on Windows is sure to fail.</b></p>

<li>Install xdstools2.war in your servlet container.  This frequently can be done by copying it to the 
webapps directory.

<li>Launch xdstools2 in your browser:   http://yourmachine:yourport/xdstools2

<li>Choose the [Toolkit Configuration] from the top of the window.  Launching this window
requires the admin password.  As delivered, it is "easy" (no quotes).

<li>Enter a new password and a location for your actors.xml file at a minimum and save.

<li>You're done.  The parameters you have just edited are stored in the file WEB-INF/toolkit.properties.

</ol>

<h1>Installing Certificates for TLS</h1>

<p>Certificates used are those types native to Java. Two sets of certificates are installed,
one to govern outgoing request and one to govern incoming requests. Usually the
same set of certificates are installed in both places.

<h2>Certificates for incoming requests</h2>
<p>Incoming requests go through Tomcat and Tomcat manages these certificates. In the Tomcat
file

<pre>
    conf/server.xml
</pre>

is a Connector definition that links configuration information, including certificates,
to a port:

<pre>
&lt;Connector port="9443" 
               maxThreads="150" minSpareThreads="25" maxSpareThreads="75"
               enableLookups="false" disableUploadTimeout="true"
               acceptCount="100" debug="0" scheme="https" secure="true"
               clientAuth="true" sslProtocol="TLS"
               log4jConfFile="/usr/local/tomcat1/conf/log4j-trustmanager.properties"
               ciphers="TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA"
	       keystoreFile="/usr/local/tomcat1/conf/keystore/EURO2010/keystore"
               keystorePass="changeit" 
	       truststoreFile="/usr/local/tomcat1/conf/keystore/EURO2010/keystore"
               truststorePass="changeit" />
</pre>

Note:
<ul>
<li>The ciphers attribute is optional, include only if you want to restrict the ciphers that 
can be used. This toolkit resticts to two ciphers, on acceptable to Windows based systems
and one acceptable to *ix based systems.  This has worked for 5 years worth of Connectathons.
<li>The keystoreFile attribute points to a keystore file, a file containing certificates with
keys that identify this port
<li>The truststoreFile attribute points to a truststore file, a file containing certificates
for all partners in a TLS relationship
<li>Note that the keystoreFile and truststoreFile can be the same
<li>See the general Java literature on how to build keystores and truststores
</ul>

<h2>Certificates for outgoing requests</h2>

<p>The certificates that are used for outgoing request are in the same format as those
for incoming requests.  In the toolkit they are stored in a separate place within the toolkit. 
See <a href="environment.html">here</a> for details.
