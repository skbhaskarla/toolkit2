<h1>Lifecycle Help</h1>

<p>This tool is used to verify the Lifecycle (RPLC/APND/XFRM) operations on a Document
Registry. It is run at Connectathon before interoperability testing of these operations
to ensure the Registry is 'up to spec' before taking time with other vendors.  Specifically
it runs the following Mesa tests:

<ul>
<li>11992 - Accept Document Replace
<li>11993 - Accept Document Addendum
<li>11994 - Accept Document Transformation
</ul>
