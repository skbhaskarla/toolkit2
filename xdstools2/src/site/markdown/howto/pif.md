# Send a Patient Identity Feed transaction to a Document Registry

Toolkit can send a V2 Patient Identity Feed transaction.

You can manually send a v2 feed by launching the tool labeled *Manage Patient IDs*.
Here you can create a new Patient ID and send it in a V2 feed to any configured system.

The Patient ID Assigning Authorities configured in the toolkit are listed on the right
side. Use a *Generate Patient ID* button to create a new Patient ID.  It will be displayed
in the *Favorite Patient IDs* list.  One you have created a Patient ID select it in this
list. Note that if you have a particular Patient ID you wish to use you can copy/paste
it into the *Add existing Patient ID* box in the top right and click *Add to Favorites*.

Once you have a Patient ID added to and selected in the Favorites box you can select a
Document Registry at the bottom of the screen and send a V2 Patient Identity Feed message.
This requires that the site configurations have the hostname and port configured. See
the *Site/Actor Configuration* tool to add this if necessary. It is created automatically
for simulators.

Note that if you want to copy/paste a Patient ID from the Favorites list, select the ID and
it will appear in the far right portion of the display where it can be swiped and copied using
keyboard or mouse commands.
