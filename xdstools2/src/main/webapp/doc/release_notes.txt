MDHT

Link to the MDHT Release used by the validator on the OHT/MDHT website: http://sourceforge.net/projects/oht-modeling/files/Nightly%20Builds/Runtime/org.openhealthtools.mdht.uml.cda.runtime.N-N20130617-201306171357.zip/download 

Defects fixed in this release:
	•	When representing lab results utilizing value reference ranges using the standard IVL_INT data type (for when high/low contain no decimal and have no units) the validator throws an error incorrectly. Going forward implementers can use IVL_INT data type.
	•	Validation of Text data elements of type “ST” which contain CDATA blocks is sensitive to white spaces. Going forward implementers can use white spaces in the ST data type along with CDATA.
	•	When Using Multiple TemplateIds to conformance, the validator is looking at the first one to verify conformance instead of checking the entire list. Community has encountered this issue on the Smoking Status Observation. Going forward implementers can use multiple template Ids in the Smoking Status observation entry.
	•	Encounter Diagnoses validation was requiring Assessment and Problem Observation even when other encounter / problem sections and entries are present. This has now been corrected to require the problem observation entry as part of Assessment based on the other sections/entries present in the document.
	•	Validation of Procedure Activity Procedure template was requiring address and telecom elements even when the represented organization was not present. This is now corrected and the validation only requires the elements when the representedOrganization is present.
	•	Validation of DocumentationOf/ServiceEvent/Performer was throwing an error when implementers were using a codesystem different from the one prescribed in C-CDA IG which is NUCC Health Care Provider Taxonomy 2.16.840.1.113883.6.101. This was changed to a WARNING as it is supposed to be per the IG.
	•	Fixed the error where the validator was not allowing multiple languageCommunication elements in a CDA document per the IG.
	•	Fixed the validator bug where an error was being generated when the comment author information includes an assignedPerson name AND a representedOrganization name.
	•	Fixed the error where the validator was using the incorrect severity when checking conformance to the confidentialityCode value set. The severity was changed from a “SHALL” to a “SHOULD”.
	•	C-CDA ERRATA’s incorporated into the release are as follows:
	◦	64, 66, 67, 60,
Known Issues in the release that impact users:
	•	Validation Errors on Payers Section with Multiple Performers, For e.g when a user is attempting to put both a performer (payer) and a performer (guarantor) in the same document the validator is providing an error.
	•	When ID’s are present on the Narrative Text element and reference them in the entries, the validator is incorrectly throwing an error.
	•	Validator incorrectly displaying a warning message for authoringDevice when author/assignedAuthor/AssignedPerson is already present which is valid per the C-CDA IG.
	•	C-CDA validator indicates smoking status observation is missing even when it exists.
165 (released 25 June 2013 )
	•	Bug fix related to parsing multipart boundary in simulators. Was not properly identifying SIMPLE vs MTOM because of bad parsing of the boundary element in the message headers.
	•	Separate Registry and Repository simulators now work together.
164 (released 20 June 2013 )
General
	•	Fixed display bug in validator where the summary indicated that errors were found but no actual errors were reported.
Direct Validation changelog:
	•	DTS 114 Orig-Date: The day of the week is now optional as recommended by the specification.
	•	TTT is now able to recognize and display properly a stylesheet file.

	•	TTT is now able to parse and decrypt application/x-pkcs7-mime messages.
	•	Fixed bug where wrapped message with singlepart attachment were not parsed.
	•	Fixed a bug in the validation of received header. The regex sometimes couldn't parse the value of the field.
	•	Removed regular expression to check quoted-printable content. It made the TTT falling to validate some emails and was obsolete.
	•	Now checking if application/xml part are CCDA content or stylesheet. Decoding QP encoded content as well.

MDN validation changelog:
	•	Fixed a bug where MDN headers were not correctly extracted which was leading the toolkit to fail validation.
	•	Fixed a bug in MDN validation where disposition field was sometimes not found.
SOAP/SAML:
	•	Fixed dateTime comparison validation, milliseconds should not be taken into account.
	•	Fixed dateTime validation, timezones and fractional milliseconds are optional.
	•	Fixed distinguished name validation.
	•	Fixed keyIdentifier namespace.
163a (released 14 May 2013 )
Bug Fixes

163 (released 10 May 2013 )
Known bugs
	•	The Document Recipient Simulator (XDR) will report a validation error: Slot intendedRecipient: 
	•	Some Hospital^^^^^^^^^1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.1789.45|^Wel^Marcus^^^Dr^MD|^^Internet^mwel@healthcare.example.org 
	•	: Format is XON|XCN  where either XON or XCN must be present
	•	 when SAML is included. In many cases this error message is incorrect. This will be fixed soon.
Bug Fixes
	•	SAML: Installed new implementation of SAML. This include SAML header generation an SAML header validation. This may cause new errors to be reported because it provides a more comprehensive validation.
	•	Direct:
	•	Fixed Orig-Date validation: Day of the week changed from required to optional Under Direct validation
Fixed DTS 165: - Signature algorithms now allowed for micalg value: sha-1, sha-256, sha1
Now checking the OID algorithm number located in the signing certificate
Fixed Base64 encoding: - Base64 encoding is now spread in several lines which contains no more than 76 characters

Bug Fixes
	•	Upgrade MDHT to 02_15_2013 release: Defects fixed in this release:
	◦	Allow Referrals to be documented as part of ÒPlan of Care SectionÓ or ÒAssessment and Plan sectionÓ or ÒReason for ReferralÓ section.
	▪	Previously the validation was over constrained and only Reason for Referral section was being allowed.
	◦	Allow Vital Signs to use sections with entries required or section with entries optional.
	▪	Previously the validation was over constrained and only Vital Signs section with entries required template was being allowed.
	◦	Allow CareTeam Members to be documented as part of either ÒEncompassingEncounter/responsiblePartyÓ or ÒEncompassingEncounter/encounterParticipantÓ or ÒdocumentationOf/ServiceEvent/PerformerÓ.
	▪	Previously the validation was looking for all three of them to exist and declaring an error incorrectly on valid samples.
	◦	Cognitive Status Problem Observation Entry was modeled with incorrect cardinality resulting in an error.
	▪	Previously the Problem Observation Entry was modeled with a cardinality of 1..* instead of 0..* which was resulting in an error.
	◦	Fixed a memory leak that was causing heap exhaustion in about 4 hours.
	◦	Pregnancy Observation was modeled with incorrect cardinality resulting in an error.
	▪	Previously Pregnancy Observation was modeled with a cardinality of 1..1 instead of 0..1 which caused a validation error for valid samples.
	◦	EncounterActivities\Code vocabulary constraints were modeled incorrectly resulting in an error.
	▪	Previously Encounter Activities \ Code was being validated to have a code system of SNOMED- CT or ICD-10 incorrectly. This has now been corrected.
	•	Known issues in this release that impact users:
	◦	No known issues
	•	XDM decoder was detecting directories incorrectly. This frequently resulted in the message Directory IHE_XDM not found even when it was present.
	•	Built with shared-lib version 160
Known problems
	•	When an XDR message is received containing a CCDA, the CCDA is validated before the response message is sent. This allows the validation errors to be included in the response. Since the CCDA validation can take a very long time to run (sometimes over a minute) the sender (Document Source actor) can timeout waiting for the SOAP response. When using toolkit as the Document Source, it does timeout.

133
	•	Problem at connectathon where a user would get results back from another user. Second symptom was getting strange stack traces instead error messages that related to real problems. Issue was bug in management of session variable. This has been fixed but the fix has broken the use of simulators. This will be fixed in a later release.
	•	Occasionally an error is repored related to not being able to load addressing module. This has been tracked to a bug in Axis2 version 1.4 libraries. Some recoding has minimized the frequency of this error. Future upgrade to version 1.5 will actually fix it.
132
	•	Added Dashboard for connectathon
	•	Finished core of IG construction including junit tests.
	•	Added better exception management to MetadataValidator page in hopes it helps solve the perceived hang problem
	•	Added Repository Listing tab - lists Repositories by their repositoryUniqueId
