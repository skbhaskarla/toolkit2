<h1>Source Stored Document Help</h1>

<p>This tool is for grading the <b>XDS.b_Doc_Source_Stores_Document</b> connectathon test.

<p>The test has an XDS Document Source submitting a single document to a Document Repository
which in turn forwards the metadata to a Document Registry. The Document Source is required
to log the XDSSubmissionSet.uniqueId to the Gazelle chat window as:
<br />
<br />
SSID: 1.2.3.4.5

<p>This tool:
<ul>
<li>Issues a GetSubmissionSetAndContents Stored Query (using the SSID) to the Registry. 
<li>The metadata returned is fully validated.
<li>Issues a Retrieve Document Set to the Repository to retrieve the document. 
<li>The document is
validated against the metadata (size, hash, mime type).
</ul>
