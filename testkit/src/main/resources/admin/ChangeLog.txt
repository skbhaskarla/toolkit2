Fixed sourcePatientInfo sourcePatientId so they contain valid
CX datatypes



Version 7.03

Test 11880 generates XDS.b instead of XDS.a - the testplan language allowed 
XDS.a/XDS.b to be specified at the plan, step or transaction level 
which made the xdstest tool implementation complicated.  Removed the 
XDS.a/XDS.b tag from the plan and step levels as part of the cleanup.
Required minor updates to a half dozen testplan files in the testkit.


On tests 12320 and 12320, added validation to show that MTOM requests return MTOM and SIMPLE SOAP requests
return SIMPLE SOAP. Change was made in MswTransaction class.

    11909  (GetRelatedDocuments)
    11906 (GetSubmissionSetAndContents)
    11880,  12000	Accept Create Folder with Initial Document (XDS.a, XDS.b)
     11908 GetFoldersForDocument Stored Query

Version 6.6

Updated all Submission Set and Document metadata to correct authorPerson format. It must be in XCN format.

Version 6.6
December 9, 2007
Test 11906 has been repaired.  The formatCode testStep was incorrect and the confidentialityCode step was missing.

The following new tests have been added to the testkit
11902 GetFolders Stored Query
11728/11969  Create Folder
11729/11970   Create Folder with Initial Document

Version 6.8
11906 GetSubmissionSetAndContents - updated to not require Assoc between folder and document.

11898 FindSubmissionSets - updated value of XDSSubmissionSet.sourceId to make it a valid OID.

11880 Accept Create Folder with Initial Document - the eval phase now also uses the GetFolderAndContents stored query to help with the evaluation.

12000 Accept Create Folder with Initial Document - the eval phase now also uses the GetFolderAndContents stored query to help with the evaluation.

Added tests
 11876  	 11996  	Reject Submission of Invalid Patient ID
 11982  	 11983  	Reject submissions where metadata and documents do not match
 11877  	 11997  	Reject Submission Set, Patient ID does not match Document
 11885  	 12004  	Reject Duplicate Document uniqueID with Different Hash
12024    Accept Retrieve Document
 12028  	Accept Retrieve Document Set with Mutual TLS
 11887  	 11986  	Return Errors from Registry
 11883  	 12084  	Submission Stored - All or Nothing

--------------------------

Fixed missing repositoryUniqueId in test 11997

These were left out of the last distribution
 11980  	 11981  	Accept Document with size, hash and URI attributes

11890 (testdata) -  URI attribute has been added so it works with XDS.a as well.  This URI points to a document on the Public Registry server.  Two testplan.xml files are included (XDS.a and XDS.b).

11909 GetRelated Stored Query - test incorrectly required original document to be returned when no matching Associations were found.  

11880 - updated evaluation to correspond to fix in GetSubmissionSetAndContents stored query

Released as Version 6.9
----------------------------------

Fixed test 11885 which expected wrong error code when document uniqueId
already present in registry and hash does not match.  Correct error code
is XDSNonIdenticalHash

Fixed test 12004 so it expects XDSNonIdenticalHash.

Fixed test 11905 so it requires Association objects

Added 12045 for Integrated Source/Repositories

Released as Version 6.10
---------------------------------

Added 11874 and 11994 - Accept Document Transformation

Added 11875 and 11995 - Accept Document Transformation/Replacement

Fixed all hash attributes so they are consistently 40 characters.

Fixed all repositoryUniqueId attributes so they are valid oids

Release as Version 6.11
--------------------------------

Updated Stored Query tests 11897, 11903, 11901, 11904, 11905, 11906, 11909, 11898 to have
separate sections for SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2. 

Release as Version 6.14
--------------------------------

New command line interface for xdstest (name xdstest2 dropped)

Removed direct support for Windows. Unix shell bash is now required

Added tests to test the basic WS patterns:
12320 SIMPLE SOAP against Registry/SQ interface
12321 MTOM/XOP and un-optimized MTOM/XOP against Repository.b/PnR
No support for XDS.a was added

Implemented CP 237 and 278 which detail the now required linking
of Folder-Document Associations to the controlling Submission Set
with a secondary Association.  This forced changes to the following
tests:
11890, 11880, 11881, 11882, 12022

Implemented CP 349 which requires SSandContents SQ to return
the Assoc between Folder and Document.  This forced changes to tests:
12000, 11906, 12022

Implemented CP 357 which adds the authorPerson parameter to the 
FindDocuments stored query.  this forced changes to the following tests:
11897

CP 303 - 
Created new test 12322 to test XDSFolder.lastUpdateTime changes.
Proper implementation of lastUpdateTime forced changes to the 
implementation of the following tests:
11899
