This Stored Query contains the Stored Query parameter $XDSDocumentEntryPracticeSettingCodeScheme which is no longer a parameter to the FindDocuments Stored Query. This parameter has been left in the query on purpose.  A Document Registry is required to ignore parameters it does not understand. It's no longer useful but its presence may not trigger an error.
