# Manage Patient IDs

This tool offers several features to manage Patient IDs.

The top left box displays a collection of favorite patient ids.  This can be added to by pasting an ID to the
box on the top right and pressing *Add to Favorites*. New Patient IDs can be generated from the Assigning
Authorities shown on the bottom right.  These Assigning Authorities get loaded from the codes.xml file found in the
Environment configuration. A V2 Patient Identity Feed can be generated to the selected Document Registry at the bottom
left.

Note that the selected Patient ID is displayed to the far right to enable COPY so it can be moved to another window. This
is a temporary solution to using Patient ID Favorites.  See the [road map](../roadmap.html) for plans in this area.

Also Note that if the Assigning Authorities in the bottom right do not display it is almost always because your web session has
timed out.
