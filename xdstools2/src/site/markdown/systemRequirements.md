# System Requirements #

Toolkit is developed primarily on Unix-based platforms but will run on Windows.
There are a few Windows-platform bugs. You can track progress on
their repair here.

The basic system requirements are:

* Java (version 5 or later)
* Tomcat (version 5 or later)

Many people use Servlet containers other than Tomcat but we develop on Tomcat
and do not have experience with the many alternatives.
