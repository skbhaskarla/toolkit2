XCR Retrieve single document

This test has two parts:

==============================================
correct - show correct operation

Generate request for the retrieval of a single document based 
on metadata returned in test 12311.

in test 12311, issue a RetrieveDocumentSet transaction to retrieve a document.  

When successful, perform the following validations:

* Single document returned

* RepositoryUniqueId matches request

* DocumentUniqueId matches request

* MimeType matches metadata from test 12311

* Document hash, as calculated after the retrieve, matches value in metadata from test 12311

* HomeCommunityId matches configuration

homeCommunityId not in request
