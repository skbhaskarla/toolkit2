<h1>Message Validator Help</h1>

<p>The Public Registry and other tools perform many validations on messages as part of their
implementation an XDS/XDR/XCA actor. This page allows these
validations to be run separately through the GUI interface. To use, upload a 
message (you have to capture your message
somehow) and select the message type.  The message type <i>Guess based on content</i> allows you 
to upload a message and have the tool tell you everything it can about the message.

<p>After the message has been validated, you can inspect the metadata via the <i>Inspect Metadata</i> button
(assuming the message contains metadata).

<h1>CCDA Validation</h1>

<p>The CCDA validation, implemented through the MDHT project at http://www.openhealthtools.org is a product
of Open Health Tools and ONC.  NIST provides only the runtime platform to make this tool available to the public.
Questions regarding the output of this tool should be directed to kevin.brady AT nist DOT gov.

<h2>CCDA Validator Release Notes</h2>

<p>Release Notes for CCDA Validator Released on 09_20_2012-1:

<p>The following are known validation issues that exist in the MU Stage 2 CCDA validator.

<ul>
<li>Functional Status validation error due to the absence of Cognitive Status template for valid
reasons.
<li>Preferred Language values are not being validated currently.
<li>Transitions of Care and View, Download, Transmit Ambulatory validations incorrectly looking for
discharge medications.
<li>Documentation of Service Event looking for only one Performer with typecode "PRF" while Care
Team Members could potentially have multiple ones. (This might actually just be a fix to the
Sample XML file).
</ul>

<h2> Data Portability Testing Cheat Sheet</h2>

<p>Last Updated: September 20, 2012 by a.viars

<p>This document is designed to guide ACTBs through process of the testing a System Under Test ("SUT")
for conformance to the MU2 criteria for "Data Portability" also known as "170.314(b)(7)". The primary
tool used in this test is the "NIST Transport Testing Tool" referred to henceforth as the "TTT".

<p>The goal of this test is to certify that an HER, or EHR component, is capable of a bulk export of all
patients' information in HL7 CCDA Transition of Care format. The motivation for such a test is to reduce
the risk of vendor "lock-in". A SUT must have a bulk export to CCDA capability to meet this criterion.

<p>When more than one occurrence of a piece of information, such as a vital sign like blood pressure,
is present in the SUT for the same patient, then the resulting CCDA must contain the most recent
information.

<p>To facilitate this test, NIST and ONC have jointly created sample data in a human-readable format. This
sample data consists of multiple patient records with multiple observations for the same patient. This
data can be found here. https://github.com/meaningfuluse/mu2/tree/master/test-data/170.314-b7

<p>These records shall be entered into the SUT by the Tester according to a SUT-specific procedure. The
Tester will then invoke the bulk patient export. This process will result in one CCDA Transition of Care
document for every patient in the SUT.

<p>The Tester will then select the resulting CCDA files for inspection using TTT. The following steps outline
the process.

<ol>
<li> Create patient records using test data for 170.134(b)(7) at the previously mentioned URL.
<li> Invoke the SUT's bulk export function to produce CCDA documents for each patient in the
system.
<li> Verify that the number of CCDA documents is equal to the number of patients in the SUT.
<li> Navigate to the TTT main page.
<li> Click "Message and CCDA document" validators
<li> Under the heading, "CCDA Document Validator", select "Transitions Of Care Ambulatory
Summary - MU2 170.314(b)(7) Export Summary - For Ambulatory Care" for ambulatory data
or "Transitions Of Care Inpatient Summary - MU2 170.314(b)(7) Export Summary - For Inpatient
Care". See Diagram 1 below.
<li> Select a corresponding CCDA, generated by the SUT, from the file system using the "Browse"
button.
<li> Click the "Validate" button to upload and process the file.
<li> View the output onscreen to determine conformance.
<li>The Test should manually validate the data labeled "Second Set" in the test data is contained in
the CCDA.
</ol>
