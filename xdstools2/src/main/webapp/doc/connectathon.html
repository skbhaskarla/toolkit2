<h1>Connectathon Tools Help</h1>

<p>This collection of tools is collected here because they are useful at Connectathon events.  
They are useful other places too.

<h2>Connectathon Validations</h2>

<p><b>XDS.b_Doc_Source_Stores_Document</b> - does a GetSubmissionSetAndContents Stored Query followed
by a Retrieve Document Set to verify a submission.

<h2>Registry Validations</h2>

<p><b>XDS.b_Registry_Do_This_First</b> - does a Register Document Set followed by a GetSubmissionSetAndContents
Stored Query to verify.  It then does a GetDocuments using the UUID parameter.

<p><b>XDS.b_Lifecycle</b> - run the collection of Pre-Connectathon tests covering Life Cycle (RPLC/APND/XFRM)
operations.

<p><b>XDS.b_Registry_Folder_Handling</b> - run the collection of Pre-Connectathon tests covering Folder 
handling.

<h2>Repository Validations</h2>

<p><b>XDS.b_Repository_Do_This_First</b> - does a Provide and Register.b to the Repository followed
by a Retrieve Document Set to verify operation of the Repsository.  Does not do a Registry Stored Query
so it does not matter which Registry the Repository forwards metadata to. 

<h2>Load Test Data</h2>

<p><b>Registry Test Data</b> - a collection of canned Register Document Set.b transactions to load test 
data into a Document Registry

<p><b>Repository Test Data</b> - a collection of canned Provide and Register Document Set.b transactions to 
load test data into a Document Repository/Document Registry pair.
