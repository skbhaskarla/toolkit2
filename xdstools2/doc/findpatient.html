<h1>Find Patient Help</h1>

<p>This tool initiates the Find Patients XCPD to a Responding Gateway of your choice. 

<p>After running the request, use the <i>Inspect Results</i> button to browse the query
response.

<p>The sites listed as potential targets for this transaction depend on the sites configured in the tool.
Responding Gateways are listed that have an endpoint for the XCPD transaction. 

<p>Note that when you change the TLS setting that the selectable sites change depending on which 
sites offer TLS/non-TLS endpoints.

<p>Selecting a site under the category of responding Gateways is adequate.  The toolkit will
generate a XCPD transaction.
