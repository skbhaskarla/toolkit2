<h1>Pre-Connectathon Test Help</h1>

<p>This tool can be thought of as a graphical interface for the old xdstest command line tool. It is
actually quite different since it is interactive and multi-user.

<p>You will need to configure the toolkit to use this page.   

<p>To configure this facility go to the home tab and open [Toolkit Configuration] at the top.  You will need
the admin password (the default is easy). Edit the property External_Cache to be the full path to an empty directory on the
system.  You need write permission to this directory.  Save the properties and go to the Pre-Connectathon Tests tab.

<p>At the top of the Pre-Connectathon Tests tab you will see a 'Test Session' entry.  A test session is just an area for
you to save your test data in.  Its only significance is that it is separate from other test sessions, so the 
data can be kept separate.  A test session can represent a different user or tests run against a different 
system.  The tool does not give it any significance other then being separate from the others. If you configured
the External_Cache to be /usr/bill/toolkit and created a test session with name bill then the resulting log files
will be found in /usr/bill/toolkit/TestLogCache/bill.  The contents of that directory is identical to the old
xdstest tool.

<p>To start using the panel, select a test session or add a new one. A test session name will become a 
directory name in the directory you created above in the Toolkit Configuration panel.  So choose a name that
is a legal directory name on your system.  If you entered /usr/bill/toolkit for External_Cache above then 
you will see the following directory structure after running a few tests:

<pre>
/usr/bill/toolkit/
                  actors.xml
                  TestLogCache/bill/tests/11903/log.xml
</pre>

where I entered for a Test Session the string <i>bill</i>.

<p>Next select the actor type to be tested.

<p>Next select the test to be run. The test README file will be displayed. 

<p>If the test has multiple sections, you can choose the section to run or run all of them in order.

<p>You can view the test plan 
(XML-based test script) using the 'View testplan' button.  If the test has multiple sections, you must
select the section first.

<p>Enter the Patient ID to be used. Not all tests require a Patient ID.

<p>Select whether you are using TLS and then the system. The system selection list will
change when you select/de-delect TLS since when you select TLS only systems configured for 
TLS will be shown. The same goes for systems without non-TLS configurations. 
To add systems, to the Site/Actor Configuration menu item 
on the home tab.

<p>After running, you can examing the logs and data by using the 'Inspect Results' button.  This takes you 
to an inspector that allows you to view metadata and log files and give access to secondary queries that
may help in debug. Note that this facility should already be familiar to most since we have been using
it at Connectathons for 2 years.

<p>Once a test is successful, you can extract the log.xml files to upload into Gazelle.  There is no tooling
support for this but above you created the directory for logs to be deposited in (the Test Session), so you can find them 
easily for upload.

<h2>Extracting log.xml files for Gazelle upload</h2>

<p>This form of the test tool generates the same log files, log.xml, as the command line version.  The
issue is where to find them so they can be uploaded. Review the External_Cache example above.  The <i>tests</i>
directory shown has the same structure as it did with the command line version of the tool.  Create your
test log zip file from that directory structure.
