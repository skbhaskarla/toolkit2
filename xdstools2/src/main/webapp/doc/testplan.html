<h1>XDSTest Language</h1>

<h2>Environments</h2>

<p>XDSTest is a language for describing tests for the XDS/XDR/XCA set of IHE profiles. 
It is made up of a language interpreter written in Java and a collection of test definitions.
Test definitions are packaged as filesystem directories. Each test definition directory contains
a key file called the testplan. Its filename is always testplan.xml. This file contains the
test instructions interpreted by the XDSTest language interpreter. The test definition directory may 
also contain other support files.  Some of the support files are referenced from within testplan.xml 
and some have fixed names that are expected by the interpreter. 

<p>The XDSTest language interpreter
is sometimes referred to as a Test Engine (the thing that executes the tests) within
the documentation below. The operation of the Test Engine is documented separately.

<p>XDSTest is deployed in two ways. First is the older, command line tool called xdstest which is
packaged in a download called the xdstoolkit. The newer approach is called XDS Toolkit.  This started
out as a GUI wrapper for the xdstoolkit but has grown past that. 

<p>The xdstoolkit deployment is constructed from several  
IheOs (the SourceForge project where the code is kept) projects:

<ul>
<li>xds-common2 - IheOs common code library 
<li>xdstest2 - the XDSTest language interpreter
<li>testkit - the collection of test definitions
<li>xdstoolkit - the deployment wrapper for the above
</ul> 

<p>The XDS Toolkit (the GUI deployment) is constructed from these projects:

<ul>
<li>xds-common2 - IheOs common code library
<li>xdstest2 - the XDSTest language interpreter
<li>testkit - the collection of test definitions
<li>xdstools2 - the GUI wrapper (actually has a lot more stuff)
</ul>

<p>In this deployment, there are actually two sources for test definitions: the testkit and
a small collection of test definitions that are integral to the operation of the tool. These
are packaged within the xdstools2 project.

<h2>Test definitions</h2>

<p>A test definition is a directory of information. Test definitions that are managed by Gazelle 
have 5 digit names such as 11710.  Tests definitions which are not managed by Gazelle can have
any name as long as it is unique within the testkit.

<p>The testkit is divided into areas with names like testdata, tests, examples. These areas 
are only significant in that they organize the tests into understandable groups.

<p>The simplest test definition (directory) contains a single file, testplan.xml. When a test
is executed (using example from the command line) via:

<pre>
xdstest -t 12345
</pre>

where 12345 is the test name (name of the directory), the test engine (xdstest) finds the testplan.xml
file and executes it.  Testplan.xml may contain multiple test steps. If it does then all steps
are executed in order. When complete a log file named log.xml is written to the log directory. The
log directory is located in either the xdstoolkit structure or the xdstools2 structure (command line
or GUI packaging). Either way, the log directory takes on the same directory structure as the testkit.

<p>Some test semantics are best described by multiple user-controlled steps. A good example is 
a query test where the first step is to initialize the Registry under test with test data 
and then subsequent steps execute queries being tested. If this was constructed as multiple
steps in a testplan then the test data would be loaded every time just before initiating the
query.  This is wasteful and makes it difficult to put the code under test in a debugger. 

<p>Test can be subdivided into sections, each section having its own testplan.xml file.  Sections
have a declared order to be run or can be run individually.  A test 23456 which has sections submit
and query can be run in it start to finish by:

<pre>
xdstest -t 23456
</pre> 

To run just the submit section:

<pre>
xdstest -t 23456 submit
</pre>

To run just the query section:

<pre>
xdstest -t 23456 query
</pre>

If the submit testplan contains multiple steps they will all be executed, just like in the simpler
case.

<p>A multi-section test has the following structure:
<ul>
<li>Each section is a directory under the test directory
<li>The section name is the directory name
<li>The ordering of the sections is defined in a file named index.idx
<li>Each section directory contains a testplan.xml file
</ul>

Our example test 23456 with sections submit and query looks like:

<pre>
23456/
23456/submit/
23456/submit/testplan.xml
23456/query/
23456/query/testplan.xml
23456/index.idx
23456/readme.txt
</pre>

<p>The index.idx file looks like:
<pre>
submit
query
</pre>

indicating the order of section execution.

<p>Also notice the last file, readme.txt.  Besides a place for test documentation, the first line
of the file is interpreted as a short description of the test.  This is used by the command line
tool when making a listing of the contents of the test kit:

<pre>
$ xdstest -ls
</pre>

will display a listing showing the test number followed by this documentation line for each test.

<h2>Test Plan file format</h2>

<p>Here is one of the simplest testplans possible:

<pre>
&lt;TestPlan>
   &lt;Test>11966/submit&lt;/Test>
    &lt;TestStep id="submit">
        &lt;ExpectedStatus>Success&lt;/ExpectedStatus>
        &lt;ProvideAndRegisterTransaction>
            &lt;XDSb/>
            &lt;MetadataFile>single_doc.xml&lt;/MetadataFile>
            &lt;Document id="Document01">my_document.txt&lt;/Document>
        &lt;/ProvideAndRegisterTransaction>
    &lt;/TestStep>
&lt;/TestPlan>
</pre>

<p>The top level element is always TestPlan.  Its first child is Test. Test documents which
test this plan implements. In this example the value 11966/submit indicates this is the testplan
for section submit of test 11966.  If 11966 had no sections (only a single testplan) then this
value would have been only 11966. This value is used in test result validation so it must be
accurate.

<p>Next is the TestStep. Each TestStep causes a single transaction to be executed. Some of the details
are:

<ul>
<li>The id attribute
is required and gives a label to the test step.  
<li>ExpectedStatus indicates the status expected
from executing the transaction.  Valid values are Success and Failure. 
<li>Each TestStep contains
a single *Transaction element, here it is ProvideAndRegisterTransaction.
<li>Within the *transaction element:
<ul>
<li>XDSb forces the generation of the XDS.b version of the transaction as opposed to the XDS.a 
version
<li>MetadataFile - the XML form of the metadata is stored in a file in the test section directory with 
the name shown
<li>Since this is a Provide and Register.b transaction that includes an ExtrinsicObject (DocumentEntry) 
there must be a document attached within the MTOM wrapper when the protocol is generated. The
Document element links the id attribute on the ExtrinsicObject element in metadata to a 
filename within the test specification.
</ul>
</ul>

<p>The following rules govern the ordering of elements within a TestPlan:

<ul>
<li>The first child of TestPlan must be Test
<li>The *Transaction elements indicate the order that the real transactions will be generated on the 
wire.
</ul>

<p>Beyond these simple rules, it is the nesting of elements that is important and not their order.

<h3>Children of TestPlan</h3>

<p>The following elements may be placed directly under the TestPlan element:

<dl>
<dt><b>&lt;Test></b>test_number<b>&lt;/Test></b>
<dd>Mandatory first child element of the TestPlan. Documents the test number that 
this testplan implements. The test number is used to coordinate with Gazelle in 
defining MESA or Pre-Connectathon tests. Gazelle requires this value to be a
5 digit number. Tests written that do not coordinate with Gazelle can use any unique
value.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;RegistryEndpoint></b>endpoint<b>&lt;/RegistryEndpoint></b>
<dd>Optional specification of a single endpoint for all TestSteps in a TestPlan.  This
instruction is coded before the first TestStep.
Use of this instruction is discouraged. A site definition should be used instead. This is used
mostly for defining regression tests for specialty endpoints on the Public Registry.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;PatientId></b>Patient ID<b>&lt;/PatientId></b>
<dd>Optional specification of a single Patient ID to be used with all test steps in this test plan.  This
instruction is coded
before the first TestStep. This bypasses the normal Patient ID processing where the Patient ID
stored in 
<pre>xdstest/patientid.txt</pre>
is used. Use of this instruction is discouraged. It exists only for forcing poorly formatted
Patient IDs in tests.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;Rule></b>text<b>&lt;/Rule></b>
<dd>Optional specification of text documenting the purpose of the test. This instruction
is ignored by the test engine. This instruction is coded before the first TestStep.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;TestStep id="step_name"></b>...<b>&lt;/TestStep></b>
<dd>A TestPlan contains one or more TestStep instructions. Each TestStep initiates a single
transaction of a particular type against a Web Services endpoint. The id attribute is required.
It assigns a label or name to the step. The id attribute must be unique among TestSteps within
the TestPlan. The specifics of a TestStep are coded as sub-instructions (child elements) of 
the TestStep.
<p>When a TestPlan is executed, all TestSteps are executed in the order specified. Each
TestStep results in a status of either Success or Failure. Subsequent 
TestStep(s) are executed even if previous TestStep(s) fail. The exception to this is when
the test engine itself fails. This terminates the TestPlan immediately without executing
the subsequent TestStep(s).
</dd>
<br />
</dl>

<h3>Children of TestStep</h3>

<p>A TestStep is used to code the execution of a single transaction. A TestStep
always initiates the transaction (defines the client side of the interaction). 
The following elements, placed directly under the TestStep element, define the 
operation of the TestStep. The elements of a TestStep should be specified in the
order of the documentation shown below. Ordering does not affect operation, only
readability.

<dl>
<dt><b>&lt;Rule></b>...<b>&lt;Rule></b>
<dd>Optional documentation for this TestStep. Contents are ignored by the test engine.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;Goal></b>...<b>&lt;/Goal></b>
<dd>Optional documentation for this TestStep. Contents are ignored by the test engine.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;RegistryEndpoint></b>endpoint<b>&lt;/RegistryEndpoint></b>
<dd>Optional specification of an endpoint for this TestStep.  This
instruction is coded before the *Transaction instruction.
Use of this instruction is discouraged. A site definition should be used instead. This is used
mostly for defining regression tests for specialty endpoints on the Public Registry.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;NewPatientId/></b>
<dd>Optional instruction to trigger the allocation of a new Patient ID. This depends on the
proper coding of the xdstest/actors.xml file. Each site definition within actors.xml may 
include a specification of an endpoint that when accessed with a HTTP GET request will return
a new Patient ID. The element name within the site definition is PidAllocateEndpoint. For this
instruction to complete sucessfully, the following conditions must exist:
<ul>
<li>PidAllocateEndpoint is defined for the currently selected site
<li>HTTP GET on that endpoint must be successful
</ul>
Successful completion of this GET causes the new Patient ID to be placed in the file 
xdstest/patientid.txt.
<p>The HTTP GET and the xdstest/patientid.txt update happen when this instruction is parsed. 
If it coded before the *Transaction instruction then the new Patient ID will be used in the
*Transaction instruction.  If coded after the *Transaction then it will affect the next TestStep.
To avoid the management of this detail, it is best to code the NewPatientId instruction
in its own TestStep as part of a NullTransaction.  It is then clear to the reader what
the intent of the operation is without remembering the finer rules of execution order.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;AltPatientId/></b>
<dd>Optional instruction to trigger the use of the Alternate Patient ID with this transaction.
Normally, each transaction that uses a Patient ID takes the value of the file
xdstest/patientid.txt.  In some tests it is necessary to generate metadata with a different
Patient ID so that a Patient ID conflict is created.  The specification of this instruction
causes the transaction to use the value of <pre>xdstest/patientid_alt.txt</pre> instead
of <pre>xdstest/patientid.txt</pre>.
No automation is offered for loading a value into xdstest/patientid_alt.txt. 
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;ExpectedStatus></b>value<b>&lt;/ExpectedStatus></b>
<dd>Required instruction to specify the necessary pass/fail result of the transaction.  The 
two acceptable values are Success and Failure.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;ExpectedErrorMessage></b>text<b>&lt;/ExpectedErrorMessage></b>
<dd>Optional instruction that causes the test engine to verify that an error returned 
in the transaction contains the proper
language fragment in the error message. This is used for regression testing of the Public
Registry since the exact messages are known. 
<p>A standard RegistryErrorList XML structure contains several attributes on the 
RegistryError element. One of them is codeContext. This instruction verifies that one of the
returned RegistryError XML structures contains the specified text in the codeContext attribute.
The check is made via the Java/String indexOf method:
<pre>
codeContext.indexOf(expectedErrorMessage) != -1
</pre> 
It is a test specification error if this instruction is specified without setting
ExpectedStatus to Failure.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;ExpectedErrorCode></b>code<b>&lt;/ExpectedErrorCode></b>
<dd>Optional instruction that causes the test engine to verify that an error returned 
in the transaction contains the proper
errorCode. This is used when the profile requires a specific
error code be returned to report a particular condition. 
<p>A standard RegistryErrorList XML structure contains several attributes on the 
RegistryError element. One of them is errorCode. This instruction verifies that one of the
returned RegistryError XML structures contains the specified code in its errorCode attribute.
<p>It is a test specification error if this instruction is specified without setting
ExpectedStatus to Failure.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>*Transaction</b>
<dd>This is a short hand notation for any of the specific transaction instructions.  This section
describes the overall characteristics of a transaction instruction and a later instruction
gives details on each individual transaction.
<p>A transaction instruction causes the indicated transaction to be initiated by the test engine.
Each transaction type has its own attributes and expectations. There must be exactly one transaction
instruction in a TestStep. The destination of a transaction, the Web Services endpoint, is obtained 
in one of two ways: it is hard coded into the TestPlan/TestStep or it is taken from the actors.xml
configuration file.

<p>The following transactions are defined within the actors.xml format:
<pre>
		r.b - Register.b transaction 
		pr.b - Provide and Register.b transaction 
		sq.b - Stored Query transaction
		xcq - Cross Gateway Query transaction
		xcr - Cross Gateway Retrieve transaction
		igq - Initiating Gateway Query transaction
		igr - Initiating Gateway Retrieve transaction
</pre>
		Note that Initiating Gateway Query transaction and Initiating Gateway Retrieve transaction
		are not transaction names defined by XCA. For testing purposes it is
		necessary to distinguish these from the Cross Gateway Query transaction and
		Cross Gateway Retrieve transaction.
		
<p>Each transaction definition can have both a secure and a non-secure endpoint specified. A
non-secure Provide and Register.b endpoint specification looks like:
<pre>
    		&lt;transaction name="pr.b">http://ihexds.nist.gov:9080/tf6/services/xdsrepositoryb&lt;/transaction>
    
</pre>
A secure Provide and Register.b endpoint specification looks like:
<pre>
    &lt;transaction name="pr.b" secure="1">https://ihexds.nist.gov:9443/tf6/services/xdsrepositoryb&lt;/transaction>
</pre>

So, when we specify a transaction of name pr.b we are saying that when the test engine sends
a Provide and Register.b transaction, here is the endpoint to use. The assumes that the site is 
already specified. The actors.xml file is organized by site. A site is a collection of IHE actors 
organized together for purposes of testing. When this tool is used at an IHE Connectathon,
each vendor is configured as a site.  Given that a site can only hold a single Registry or Repository,
if a vendor has two Registry implementations they must be defined as separate sites.  Usually there
is only one site definition per Registry/Repository/Gateway vendor.

<p>The site selection is never done within a TestPlan.  In the command line xdstest tool, it is 
specified on the command line and in the GUI it is a radio button selection.

</dd>
<br />

</dl>

<h3>Transactions</h3>

<p>The following transactions may be specified (real values for *Transaction). There is a 
standard collection of details which may be specified within a *Transaction instruction. 
These elements are documented in the next section.

<dl>
<dt><b>&lt;ProvideAndRegisterTransaction></b>...<b>&lt;/ProvideAndRegisterTransaction></b>
<dd>Provide and Register Document Set (a or b)
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;RegisterTransaction></b>...<b>&lt;/RegisterTransaction></b>
<dd>Register Document Set (a or b)
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;StoredQueryTransaction></b>...<b>&lt;/StoredQueryTransaction></b>
<dd>Registry Stored Query (a or b)
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;RetrieveTransaction></b>...<b>&lt;/RetrieveTransaction></b>
<dd>Retrieve Document Set
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;MPQTransaction></b>...<b>&lt;/MPQTransaction></b>
<dd>Multi-Patient Query
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;XCQTransaction></b>...<b>&lt;/XCQTransaction></b>
<dd>Cross Community Query
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;XCRTransaction></b>...<b>&lt;/XCRTransaction></b>
<dd>Cross Community Retrieve
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;IGQTransaction></b>...<b>&lt;/IGQTransaction></b>
<dd>Stored Query between a Document Consumer and an Initiating Gateway
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;IGRTransaction></b>...<b>&lt;/IGRTransaction></b>
<dd>Stored Query between a Document Consumer and an Initiating Gateway
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;NullTransaction></b>...<b>&lt;/NullTransaction></b>
<dd>No transaction is sent.  This is a noop to allow side effects to take place
without the necessity of sending a message.  This is frequently used with the
&lt;NewPatientId/> instruction.  The effect is that a new Patient ID is allocated
and this operation happens in its own TestStep for readability and clarity
in the resulting log files.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;EpsosTransaction></b>...<b>&lt;/EpsosTransaction></b>
<dd>Special combined Cross Community Query and Cross Community Retrieve
created for the European epSOS project.
</dd>
<br />

</dl>

<h3>Children of *Transaction</h3>

<p>The following elements may be placed directly under any *Transaction element. These
elements control the details of the operation of the transaction.

<dl>
<dt><b>&lt;Metadata></b>metadata XML<b>&lt;/Metadata></b>
<dd>The contents of this element is the actual metadata to be sent in the transaction.
This will be the contents of the SOAP Body:
<pre>
    &lt;Envelope>
        &lt;Body>
            metadata XML goes here
        &lt;/Body>
    &lt;/Envelope>
</pre>

Once the metadata is read, there are a number of steps of "processing" that occur before it
is sent in the transaction:
<ul>
<li>Update the metadata based on linkage from previous test steps or test
sections. Linkage is necessary so that values available in one test step (for example a UUID 
returned from a Stored Query) can be used in subsequent test step (for example using that UUID
in a second Stored Query). Linkage is implemented by writing values to the log file in one
test step and reading them in a second test step. This works when the two test steps
are in the same test plan and when they are in different test plans. Obviously if the referenced
test step is in a different test plan, that test plan must be run first and the log
file must be available. There are currenty 3 independent mechanisms for defining linkages: UseId,
Report/UseReport, and UseRepositoryUniqueId.  These are defined later in this section.
<li>The metadata is parsed and run through the Metadata Validator (see ParseMetadata below 
to bypass this)
<li>Patient ID is inserted based on the file xdstest/patientid.txt
<li>Unique IDs are inserted into each metadata object as managed by the files
xdstest/uniqueid_base.txt and xdstest/uniqueid_incr.txt (see NoAssignUids below)
<li>Symbolic ids are translated into UUIDs (see AssignUuids below)
<li>Source Ids is inserted into metadata from the file xdstest/sourceid.txt
<li>Metadata is translated into XDS.b format.  This tool was developed before the creation
of the XDS.b profile.  As a result, the metadata in most test definitions is specified in
XDS.a format.  Depending on the presence of the XDSa or XDSb instructions, the metadata
is translated into the required format before sending.
</ul>
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;MetadataFile></b>metadata XML file name<b>&lt;/MetadataFile></b>
<dd>This is an alternate form of the &lt;Metadata/> element.  In this case the value is the
file name of the file holding the metadata.  The filename is specified relative to the
test directory (the directory holding the testplan.xml file).
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;NoMetadata/></b>
<dd>Perform no metadata processing other then Report/UseReport linkage management.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;ParseMetadata></b>value<b>&lt;/ParseMetadata></b>
<dd>Value is True or False. Default value is True. This controls whether the input metadata
is interpreted as a submission.  If interpreted as a submission, there must be a 
SubmissionSet present.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;AssignUuids/></b>
<dd>Metadata data objects can have symbolic values for ids or UUIDs. By default the id
values coded in the input metadeata are sent.  If this instruction is present, then 
UUIDs are allocated and assigned to all non-UUID id attributes. 
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;NoAssignUids></b>
<dd>All SubmissionSet, DocumentEntry, and Folder objects carry a UniqueId attribute. By
default, this tool assigns unique values to these attributes before submission. The values
coded in the input metadata are overwritten.  This instruction supresses the allocation
and assignment of Unique Ids.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;XDSa/></b>
<dd>Metadata in transaction is converted to valid XDS.a format before sending. For the
transactions Provide and Register, Register, and Retrieve, this instruction or XDSb
must be present.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;XDSb/></b>
<dd>See XDSa
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;NoConvert/></b>
<dd>Override the processing implied by XDSa or XDSb.  Perform no version translation.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;UseId></b>...<b>&lt;/UseId></b>
<dd>UseId - when a TestStep is run, the test engine reports a collection of ids that are
generated for the transaction. Usually this includes generated Unique IDs, 
UUIDs, and the Submission Set SourceId attribute. Within the log file they look like this:
<pre>
     &lt;AssignedUids>
         &lt;Assign symbol="Document01" id="1.42.20100927162517.2"/>
         &lt;Assign symbol="SubmissionSet01" id="1.42.20100927162517.3"/>
      &lt;/AssignedUids>
      &lt;AssignedSourceId>
         &lt;Assign symbol="SubmissionSet01" id="1.3.6.1.4.1.21367.2010.1.2.900"/>
      &lt;/AssignedSourceId>
      &lt;AssignedUuids>
         &lt;Assign symbol="Document01" id="urn:uuid:e64dacbd-fd20-4cd7-a38b-f56bc81e0d46"/>
         &lt;Assign symbol="ID_349128474_2" id="urn:uuid:dad542b7-5f51-471e-854a-d7d6e8967253"/>
         &lt;Assign symbol="ID_349128474_1" id="urn:uuid:46a4a3f8-805c-40dc-a789-94b9c8e00da3"/>
         &lt;Assign symbol="SubmissionSet01" id="urn:uuid:4a7f8fa1-8649-4144-8ca7-cfcd9dcceeed"/>
      &lt;/AssignedUuids>
</pre>
Since these are used so often, they are reported to the log file automatically and can be referenced 
in subsequent test steps using the UseId instruction. UseId has these attributes:
<ul>
<li>testdir - identifies the directory of the testplan whose output is being used.  It is specified
relative the the current directory (the directory holding the testplan currently being executed).
This attribute is optional.  If not present then the other attributes identify an earlier
test step from the current test plan. 
<li>step - the id of the test step producing the value to be used
<li>section - one of the following values: AssignedUids, AssignedSourceId, AssignedUuids
<li>id - this matches the symbol attribute in AssignedUids, AssignedSourceId, or AssignedUuids
<li>symbol - symbol in the current metadata whose value is to be overwritten. A symbol in this context
always has the syntax $symbol_name$
</ul>
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;Report></b>...<b>&lt;/Report></b>
<dd>Report/UseReport - this is a publish/subscribe style linkage.  The test step producing
a value Reports its value with a Report element containing the following attributes:
<ul>
<li>name - the report name. This is how a UseReport later references this value
<li>section - the section of the log file the value comes out of.  Typical values for this attribute
are InputMetadata and Result
</ul>
The text value of the Report element is an XPath expression that is evaluated against the section
of the log file labeled by the section attribute. An example Report:
<pre>
            &lt;Report name="docid" section="InputMetadata">
                //*[local-name()='ExtrinsicObject']/@id           
            &lt;/Report>
</pre>
The resulting section in the log file looks like:
<pre>
            &lt;Reports>
               &lt;Report name="docid">urn:uuid:32eac58d-20da-44a0-9d97-cea8ee398a74&lt;/Report> 
            &lt;/Reports>
</pre>
In the test step that wants to use the value from a Report, the following UseReport instruction
is coded:
<pre>
            &lt;UseReport section="query" step="by_uid" reportName="repuid" useAs="$repuid$"/>
</pre>
where the attributes mean:
<ul>
<li>test - test number/name of the test referenced. Use of this parameter is discouraged.
It is easier to maintain tests when the cross-test references stay within a test
definition. This is optional and not used when the reference is within the same test.
<li>section - test section being referenced. This is optional since not all tests use sections.
<li>step - test step being referenced. This is required.
<li>reportName - name of the Report being referenced.
<li>useAs - Variable name, in $name$ format, that will be replaced in the InputMetadata
section of the current test step. It may be easier to think of the variable name as a text 
pattern. Update performs a global text replace. The $name$ pattern is replaced with the value of the
Report referenced.
</ul>
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;UseReport/></b>
<dd>See Report.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;UseRepositoryUniqueId ... /></b>
<dd>Extract the DocumentEntry.repositoryUniqueId attribute out of a Stored Query 
response message.  Example is:
<pre>
    &lt;UseRepositoryUniqueId testdir="../query" id="Document01" step="by_uid"
            symbol="$repuid$"/>
</pre>
where:
<ul>
<li>testdir defines the relative path to a directory holding a testplan
<li>step defines the step within the testplan
<li>id defines the id of the DocumentEntry that the repositoryUniqueId should be
extracted from
<li>symbol defines the symbol to be replaced in the input metadata in the current transaction
</ul>
<p>This instruction is used to link the output of a Stored Query to the generation of a
Retrieve Document Set transaction.

<dt><b>&lt;Assertions></b>...<b>&lt;/Assertions></b>
<dd>An assertion is an XPath boolean expression used to verify a post condition on a 
transaction. An example assertion set looks like:
<pre>
    &lt;Assertions>
         &lt;DataRef file="THIS" as="output"/>
         &lt;Assert id="todaysDate">
              substring(//StoredQueryTransaction[@step="verify_no_time_submission"]/Result/*[local-name()='AdhocQueryResponse']/*[local-name()='RegistryObjectList']/*[local-name()='RegistryPackage']/*[local-name()='Slot'][@name='lastUpdateTime']/*[local-name()='ValueList']/*[local-name()='Value'],1,8)
              = "$DATE$"                    
         &lt;/Assert>
    &lt;/Assertions>
</pre>
Where the id attribute gives the assertion a name that is echoed in the output when an
assertion fails.  The text body of the Assert element is an XPath expression that evalutes
to a boolean. The Assertions section contains one or more assertions (Assert elements).
The DataRef statement is required and indicates that the target of the XPath expression
is the current log file (the one being generated by this testplan). Referencing other log files
is not supported at the present time.
$DATE$ is a special variable provided by the tool which evaluates to the current date.
<p>When assertions run, they are evaluated in the order defined.  If any assertion evaluates
to False then the test step fails.

<dt><b>&lt;SOAPHeader></b>...<b>&lt;/SOAPHeader></b>
<dd>This section defines extra SOAP Headers, beyond the required WS-Addressing headers,
to be included in the request message.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;WSSECHeader></b>...<b>&lt;/WSSECHeader></b>
<dd>This section defines WS-Security headers to be included in the SOAP Header.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;NoPatientId/></b>
<dd>During normal processing of a metadata submission, each Patient ID attribute present in the
metadata (Submission Set, DocumentEntry, Folder) is replaced with the current Patient ID
stored in the tool.  This instruction prevents this operation.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;SOAP11/></b>
<dd>By default, SOAP 1.2 is generated on all transactions.  This instruction causes
SOAP 1.1 to be used instead.
</dd>
<br />

<dt><b>&lt;WaitBefore></b>delay in milliseconds<b>&lt;/WaitBefore></b>
<dd>By default test steps are executed in order without delay.  This instructions inserts
a delay, specified in milliseconds, before the execution of the current test step. The delay
specification must be an integer. This is useful when testing the Folder.lastUpdateTime attribute.
A Folder creation followed by an 'add document' can happen quick enough that registries that
maintain only 1 second resolution on this attribute can naturally have the same time
from the creation and the update.  The delay forces a different time so the proper handling
of this attribute can be tested.

<p>The following transactions may have the following specialty elements within:</p>

<h4>StoredQueryTransaction</h4>

<dl>
<dt>ExpectedContents
<dd>Declare the required contents of a Stored Query.  If the metadata content of the query response
does not match this pattern then the test step fails. Example:
<pre>
            &lt;ExpectedContents>
                &lt;SubmissionSets count="1"/>
                &lt;Associations count="4"/>
                &lt;Documents count="1"/>
                &lt;Folders count="1"/>
                &lt;SSwithOneDocOneFol/>
            &lt;/ExpectedContents>
</pre>
Two kinds of expected contents can be specified: count style and pattern style. The evaluation
of each assertion is independent of the others.  The count style assertions are:
<ul>
<li>SubmissionSets
<li>Associations
<li>Documents  (really DocumentEntries)
<li>Folders
<li>ObjectRefs
</ul>
As shown in the example.
The pattern style assertions are:
<ul>
<li><b>SSwithOneDoc</b> - SubmissionSet containing one DocumentEntry. SubmissionSet has status Approved.
<li><b>SSApproved</b> - Contains SubmissionSet with status Approved.
<li><b>DocDep</b> - All DocumentEntries have status Deprecated.
<li><b>DocApp</b> - All DocumentEntries have status Approved.
<li><b>HasRPLC</b> - Contains an RPLC association.
<li><b>DocRplcDoc</b> - Contains two DocumentEntries linked by RPLC association. The
RPLC targetObject DocumentEntry has status Deprecated and the sourceObject
DocumentEntry has status Approved.
<li><b>OneDocDep</b> - Contains one Deprecated DocumentEntry.
<li><b>OneDocApp</b> - Contains one Approved DocumentEntry
<li><b>FolApp</b> - All Folders present have status Approved
<li><b>SSwithTwoDoc</b> - Contains 1 SubmissionSet linked to two DocumentEntries by
HasMember Associations. The SubmissionSet has status Approved.
<li><b>SSwithOneDocOneFol</b> - Contains 1 SubmissionSet, 1 DocumentEntry, and 1
Folder and 4 HasMember Associations. The Associations are: SubmissionSet to DocumentEntry,
SubmissionSet to Folder, Folder to DocumentEntry, SubmissionSet to 
Folder-DocumentEntry HasMember Association.
<li><b>SSwithTwoDocOneFol</b> - Contains 1 SubmissionSet, 2 DocumentEntries,
1 Folder, and 7 HasMember Associations.  The Associations Are:
SubmissionSet to DocumentEntry(1), 
SubmissionSet to DocumentEntry(2),
SubmissionSet to Folder, 
Folder to DocumentEntry(1),
Folder to DocumentEntry(2), 
SubmissionSet to Folder-DocumentEntry(1) HasMember Association,
SubmissionSet to Folder-DocumentEntry(2) HasMember Association
<li><b>SSwithTwoDocOneFolOneDocInFol</b> - Contains 1 SubmissionSet, 2 DocumentEntries,
1 Folder, and 5 HasMember Associations.  The Associations Are:
SubmissionSet to DocumentEntry(1), 
SubmissionSet to DocumentEntry(2),
SubmissionSet to Folder, 
Folder to DocumentEntry(1),
SubmissionSet to Folder-DocumentEntry(1) HasMember Association.
<li><b>SSwithOneFol</b> - Contains one SubmissionSet, no DocumentEntries, one 
Folder and one HasMember Association linking the Folder to the SubmissionSet.
<li><b>None</b> - Contains no SubmissionSets, no DocumentEntries, no Folders, and
no Associations.
