Initialize XDS.b for Registry Stored Query Testing

This test data is suitable for Stored Query testing only. It uses Register.b to load the Registry.
The Repository references in metadata are fake.

It must be submitted against a new Patient ID.  Queries that
reference this data are sometimes graded by how many
objects they return.  If extra data is loaded in this Patient ID
then these counts can be invalidated.
