XDR Provide and Register.b with Limited Metadata but without Limited Metadata label

This Provide and Register contains a single DocumentEntry with the
necessary Submission Set and HasMember Association. The metadata 
provided conforms to the requirements
of the XDR Metadata Limited Document Source.  Only the 
absolutely required attributes are included.  

But, the SubmissionSet and DocumentEntry are missing the Classification
(label) that indicates Limited Metadata is provided.  As a result
the Document Recipient expects to find full metadata.

In this metadata, both the SubmissionSet and DocumentEntry
conform to the Limited Metadata specification.  The
profile does not require this of all objects in a submission.
