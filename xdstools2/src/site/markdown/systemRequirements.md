# System Requirements #

Toolkit is developed primarily on Unix-based platforms but will run on Windows.
There were a number of Windows-platform bugs but we believe these have been
solved.  If you experience any problems running windows please report it.

The basic system requirements are:

* Java (version 7 or later)
* Tomcat (version 7 or later)

Many people use Servlet containers other than Tomcat but we develop on Tomcat
and do not have experience with the many alternatives.
