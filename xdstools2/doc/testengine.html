<h1>Test Engine Documentation</h1>

<p>The XD* Test Engine, also known as xdstest, is a testing client built to test servers. It
implements the following IHE actors:

<ul>
<li>Document Source
<li>Document Consumer
<li>Document Repository
<li>Initiating Gateway
</ul>

in such a way that they can be used to test these IHE actors:

<ul>
<li>Document Repository
<li>Document Registry
<li>Document Recipient
<li>Responding Gateway
</ul>

<p>The documentation is split into the following sections:

<br />

<br /><a href="testengineconcepts.html">Concepts</a> - overview and structure

<br />Environments - the testing environments it fits into

<br />Operation - how to use it

<br /><a href="testplan.html">Language Definition</a> - the testplan language definition
