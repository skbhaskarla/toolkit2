<h1>Get Submission Set and Contents Help</h1>

<p>This tool initiates the GetSubmissionSetandContents Stored Query to the Document Registry, 
Initiating Gateway,
or Responding Gateway of your choice. 

<p>After running the query, use the <i>Inspect Results</i> button to browse the query
response.



<p>The sites listed as potential targets for this transaction depend on the sites configured in the tool.
Document Registries are listed that have an endpoint for the Stored Query transaction. 

<p>Note that when you change the TLS setting that the selectable sites change depending on which 
sites offer TLS/non-TLS endpoints.

<p>Selecting a site under the category of Document Registry is adequate.  The toolkit will
generate a Stored Query transaction. Selecting a site under the category of Responding
Gateway is adequate.  The toolkit will generate a Cross-Community query. Selecting a 
site under the category of Initiating Gateway is not adequate. A Responding
Gateway must also be selected. The tookit will generate
a Stored Query to the Initiating Gateway.  The Initiating Gateway will forward the
query, as a Cross-Community Query, to the selected Responding Gateway.
