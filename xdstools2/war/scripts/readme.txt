This directory contains useful scripts, sometimes for debugging
or installation validation and sometimes they are just useful 
tools.  

For any of these two work, the toolkit must be installed on
a Unix-like system with bash installed. Each utility must
be executed from this directory.  Relative file paths
are used to reference necessary parts of the toolkit and
these paths are constructed assuming this is the working directory.

Each utility accepts the -h command line parameter which will
display hopefully usefull help information.

Sub-directories exist to hold support files for the utilities.
