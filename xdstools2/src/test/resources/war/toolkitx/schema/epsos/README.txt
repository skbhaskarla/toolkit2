This Schema describes the messages used in XDS.b/XCA/XDR which use
the ebXML Registry version 3 Schema as there base.  The only IHE
extensions are in adding the schema for the RetrieveDocumentSet
transaction.  This is found in the file XDS.b_DocumentRepository.xsd.
All other Schema files are from OASIS. The only changes we have made
is to fix some well known bugs in the originals.
