<h1>Simulator Message View Help</h1>

<p>This is the control screen for viewing simulator input/output for various IHE/ITI actors. Each simulator 
focuses on one actor out of one profile. Eventually there will be simulators for all 
actors and transactions for the XDS, XDR, and XCA profiles.

<h2>Finding and understanding your message</h2>

<p>The Simulator list on the left lists all simulators currently open in the Simulator Control tab. 
A simulator is active once it is created in the Simulator Control tab but it is only visible
in the Simulator Message view tab when it is open in the Simulator Control tab. Start by selecting
you simulator.

<p>Under the Transaction listing, select All.

<p>Under the Messages listing, select the message of interest.  They are listed by date/time
of creation and transaction type.

<p>Once the message is selected, the three main panels will be filled in:  Request Message,
Response Message, Log.  The request message is shown exactly as it is received.  The one exception
is that HTTP headers may not be in the same order as they were on the wire. The response
message is shown but without many of the HTTP headers. The log section gives many details of 
the operation of the simulator. It replaces the Test Log that is currently used on the Public Registry
server.

<p>Each step of message processing is done by a validator. Some of the validators used are as 
follows (taken from a Metadata Update message):
<ul>
<li><b>HttpMessageValidator</b> - parse HTTP message, schedule correct SOAP parser (SIMPLE SOAP vs MTOM/XOP)
<li><b>SimpleSoapMessageValidator</b> - validate SIMPLE SOAP message
<li><b>SoapMessageValidator</b> - validate common SOAP elements
<li><b>WrapperValidator</b> - validate correct XML wrappers, as specified by ebRIM/ebRS, are in place.  Technically this
is part of Schema validation but schema error messages in this area tend to be hard to interpret.
<li><b>MetadataOrderValidator</b> - validate the ordering of elements within metadata. Technically this
is part of Schema validation but schema error messages in this area tend to be hard to interpret.
<li><b>SchemaValidator</b> - run schema validation.
<li><b>MetadataMessageValidator</b> - validate the structure and content of each of the major metadata objects (
SubmissionSet, DocumentEntry, Folder, Association)
<li><b>MuSim</b> - Run the Metadata Update processing
<li><b>MetadataPatternValidator</b> - analysis of Associations contained in the message
<li><b>RegistryResponseGenerator</b> - generate RegistryResponse given the above processing
<li><b>SoapWrapperRegistryResponseSim</b> - wrap the response in the correct SOAP wrapper 
</ul>

<p>You will also see many instances of the NullMessageValidator (which can be ignored) and lines labeled
with ValidationContext which give offer a view into what the validation system thinks the message type is.  
On Update messages, you can see within a ValidationContext a MetadataPatterns:[ list ] pattern.  This list
holds the message level validation patterns that have been recognized. It is this pattern recognition
that satisfies the simulator's /validator suffix on the WS endpoint. See the Simulator Endpoints section of
(<a href="http://ihewiki.wustl.edu/wiki/index.php/XDS_Test_Kit_2009-2010_Test_Descriptions#15801">here</a>)
for additional discussion.

<h2>Reporting Results</h2>

<p>The Simulator Message view is used to report Pre-Connectathon test results in much the way that the Test
Log was on the older Public Registry. Once a message has been selected from the Message list, a <i>Download 
Message</i> link will appear in the lower left corner of the tab. This will cause a file download of the 
contents of the log entry, formatted into a jar file.  The file will be named timestamp.jar where timestamp
is replaced with the actual timestamp. When reporting results, make sure the log contains the required 
MetadataPattern.  For example, test 15801 is testing DocumentEntry update and is run with the /UpdateDocumentEntry
validation suffix on the endpoint.  A matching and successful log will end with:

<pre>
SoapWrapperRegistryResponseSim
   ValidationContext: Request;MU;Updateable;MetadataPatterns:[UpdateDocumentEntry]
        Wrapping response in SOAP Message
</pre>

<h2>Message processing</h2>

Each actor defines a collection of endpoints for use by the various transactions. A message
received is processed by the following steps as appropriate:
<ul>
<li>Request message stored
<li>HTTP parser
<li>SOAP parser (MTOM/XOP if appropriate)
<li>ebRS/ebRIM schema validation
<li>Metadata structure validation (beyond what schema can do)
<li>Code validation
<li>Actor/profile defined processing
<li>Response generated
<li>Response logged
<li>Separate processing log generated (giving details of processing)
<li>Repository content stored 
<li>Registry content stored
</ul>

<p>The validation steps are generally taken from the Public Registry server implementation. Many
are extensons of that work.

<p>Why do this when the Public Registry already exists?  Many many reasons:

<ul>
<li>Apache Axis2 is not used. From my code I can provide easy to debug from error messages when your
web service requests are not quite right the first time. Axis2 tries to accept any message
so it can play nice with everyone.  When it cannot it generates either no error messages or
ones that are tough to understand.  My implemention tries to validate to the standards and 
give easy to digest error messages.
<li>No database engine is used. The entire XDS Toolkit which this simulator system is part of
requires only a Servlet engine like Tomcat (which I use in my development and deployment).
This makes it easy to run at home.  No elaborate installation instructions like those necessary
for the Public Registry implementation.
<li>No big back end registry running on that non-existant database.  The Public Registry
utilizes an open source ebRS/ebRIM 2.1 registry implementation called ebxmlrr.  This 
implementation is quite old.  XDS.b doesn't even use the 2.1 version of the standard.
<li>New actors are really easy to implement. This may not mean much to you but I will be able
to offer more testing services on this new architecture.
<li>You control the removal of your data from the system.  Each submission is packaged and
stored as a unit. The simulator control panel lets you look at each submission and
delete the ones you don't want any more. Your queries target only your submissions.  More
on this below under the discusson of private vs. shared simulators.
<p>This implementation is focused on helping to debug your actor implementations.  
The Public Registry implementation
has been used to run HIMSS demonstrations in the early years and was never really good at
debugging. 
<p>The XDS Toolkit, including the simulators, is installed via a single war file assuming
you have a Servlet Container running on your system.
</ul>

<p>What are the problems with this approach?

<ul>
<li>First, there is a lot of new code so bugs will exist. Nothing new here.
<li>The simulators are not intended to be high performance. If you want decent performance, clean
out your data when you are done with it.
</ul>
  

<p>Has any of this been used before?

<p>The simulators are new but the general queries and connectathon tools have help run
two connectathons so far (as of Sept 2010).


<p>What code is reused from the Public Registry?

<p>Metadata parser, metadata validation, registry adaptor functions, stored query parser. Basically
anything not directly tied to Axis2 or the old ebxmlrr implementation is reused.

<h2>Simulator types</h2>

<p>In general there are two types of simulators, private and shared.  Private simulators
sense your client station IP address and give you a private data store/logging facility to 
support your testing.  If you are one of those lucky few that have problems with IP addresses
because your corporate facility does virtual connections with dummy IP addresses this may not 
help you much.  This is intented to support private testing, technically conformance testing,
where you testing your Document Source against our Document Repository and Document Registry 
for example. This type of testing is also called MESA or Pre-Connectathon testing.

<p>A second type of simulator will be offered soon, a shared simulator. Where a private simulator
relies on detecting your IP address to give you private space for your messages, a shared
simulator relies on a simulator-id which is assigned to you by the toolkit. This might allow you
to testing your Document Source against an associate''s Document Consumer relying on
our Document Repository and Document Registry simulators in the middle. This style of simulator
will be a big player in enabling workflow testing at Connectathons. Workflow testing is another
name for interoperability testing.  The difficulty in coordinating this type of testing is when
one of the partner is not ready.  This holds everyone else up.  With these simulators, a
simulator can be used to support a workflow test where necessary until the vendor supplied
implementations are ready.

<h2>Simulator endpoints</h2>

<p>Simulator endpoints are constructed as follows:<br /><br />

<pre>
    http://toolkitaddr:toolkitport/xdstools2/simulator/simid/actor/transaction
</pre>

where:<br /><br />

toolkitaddr and toolkitport are defined by where the toolkit is installed <br /><br />

xdstools2/simulator are a constant  <br /><br />

simid is the id of the simulator. For now this is always the string pvt (for private simulator)
<br /><br />

actor is the name of the profile-actor pair that is implemented<br /><br />

transction is the name of the transaction within the profile-actor<br /><br />

<p>As an example, the epsos simulator on the Public Registry server which accepts Cross-Gateway
Query Retrieve (Epsos specific transaction) uses the endpoint:

<pre>
	http://ihexds.nist.gov:9080/xdstools2/simulator/pvt/epsos/xcqr
</pre>

<h2>Simulator Architecture</h2>

<p>Simulators are constructed from a collection of components. The log output shows the
components as they run along with details of their operation and possibly error messages. A
simulator for a profile/actor/transaction is constructed out of three phases: 
<ul>
<li>Multiple message validators (each focuses on a particular part of the message)
<li>A single actor definition
<li>Multiple simulator phases which collectively evaluate the request message against the
stored content of the actor and produce a response message.
</ul>

<p>As an example here are the details for the Epsos Cross-Community Query Retrieve which 
is a Cross-Community Query that include the queried documents in the response. Note this is 
different from the ITI define Cross-Community Query in that it uses MTOM (both directions).

<p>The message validators used are:

<ul>
<li>HttpMessageValidator - checks the Content-Type HTTP header and schedules the MTOM parser
<li>MtomMessageValidator - decomposes the MTOM/Multipart structure identifying the start
part (contains the metadata/query request).  Creates the MultipartContainer which is a
passive validator - a container for the message parts so later phases can find them easily.
<li>MultipartContainer - that container
<li>NullMessageValidator - 
<li>SoapMessageValidator - validates the SOAP envelope, header (including WS-Addressing) and body
<li>SchemaValidator - Schema validates the SOAP body (AdhocQueryRequest in this case)
<li>QueryRequestMessageValidator - parses and validates the query request and its parameters
</ul>

<p>The actor is silent in terms of log output

<p>The simulator phases are:

<ul>
<li>SqSim - basic stored query operation
<li>XCQSim - decorates stored query with homeCommunityId
<li>AdhocQueryResponseGenerator - generates AdhocQueryResponse message including any error messages
<li>SoapWrapperRegistryResponseSim - wraps response in SOAP body/envelope, wraps that in MTOM, 
attaches MTOM/XOP style attachments (the document contents)
</ul>

<h2>EPSOS Simulator</h2>

<p>The EPSOS spec is comprised of two pieces: XDR for sending documents and metadata in a 
Provide and Register.b transacton and a modified Cross Community Query that returns
the document contents with the query response.  Since this transacton carries documents,
its request and response must both be MTOM/XOP encoded.

<p>The toolkit provides a simulator that will accept the XDR and query/retrieve
transactons at:

<ul>
<li>Provide and Register.b - http://host:port/xdstools2/simulator/pvt/epsos/pnr
<li>Query/Retrieve - http://host:port/xdstools2/simulator/pvt/epsos/xcqr
</ul>

<p>To test the installation, create a site with the toolkit, I call mine epsos, that
has the necessary transaction defined:

<ul>
<li>Repository/repositoryUniqueId (necessary in the configuration) even though 
a traditional retrieve will not be used
<li>Repository/Provide and Register - http://host:port/xdstools2/simulator/pvt/epsos/pnr
<li>Epsos Responding Gateway/Epsos Cross-Community Query/Retrieve -
http://host:port/xdstools2/simulator/pvt/epsos/xcqr
</ul>

<p>With the configuration, go to the menu 
<pre>
    Home => Connectathon Tools => Repository Test Data
</pre>
and enter a Patient ID, select a test data set, select EPSOS as the repository, 
click TLS off and hit Run.  (The tool should distinguish Repositories from Recipients but
does not yet.)

<p>Assuming this was successful, move to the menu
    Home => Simulator Control
<pre>
<p>and select the epsos actor and then 
    
</pre>
