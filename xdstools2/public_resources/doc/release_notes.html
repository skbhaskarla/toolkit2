<br><br>
Defects fixed in this release: 
<ul>
<li>When representing lab results utilizing value reference ranges using the standard IVL_INT data type (for when high/low contain no decimal and have no units) the validator throws an error incorrectly. Going forward implementers can use IVL_INT data type.</li>
<li>Validation of Text data elements of type “ST” which contain CDATA blocks is sensitive to white spaces. Going forward implementers can use white spaces in the ST data type along with CDATA.</li>
<li>When Using Multiple TemplateIds to conformance, the validator is looking at the first one to verify conformance instead of checking the entire list. Community has encountered this issue on the Smoking Status Observation. Going forward implementers can use multiple template Ids in the Smoking Status observation entry.</li>
<li>Encounter Diagnoses validation was requiring Assessment and Problem Observation even when other encounter / problem sections and entries are present. This has now been corrected to require the problem observation entry as part of Assessment based on the other sections/entries present in the document.</li>
<li>Validation of Procedure Activity Procedure template was requiring address and telecom elements even when the represented organization was not present. This is now corrected and the validation only requires the elements when the representedOrganization is present.</li>
<li>Validation of DocumentationOf/ServiceEvent/Performer was throwing an error when implementers were using a codesystem different from the one prescribed in C-CDA IG which is NUCC Health Care Provider Taxonomy 2.16.840.1.113883.6.101. This was changed to a WARNING as it is supposed to be per the IG.</li>
<li>Fixed the error where the validator was not allowing multiple languageCommunication elements in a CDA document per the IG.</li>
<li>Fixed the validator bug where an error was being generated when the comment author information includes an assignedPerson name AND a representedOrganization name.</li>
<li>Fixed the error where the validator was using the incorrect severity when checking conformance to the confidentialityCode value set. The severity was changed from a “SHALL” to a “SHOULD”.</li>
<li>C-CDA ERRATA’s incorporated into the release are as follows:</li>
<ul><li>64, 66, 67, 60,</li></ul>
</ul>
Known Issues in the release that impact users:<br>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade MDHT to 02_15_2013 release:<br />
Defects fixed in this release:
  <ul>
	<li>Allow Referrals to be documented as part of ÒPlan of Care SectionÓ or ÒAssessment and Plan sectionÓ or
ÒReason for ReferralÓ section.
		<ul>
			<li>Previously the validation was over constrained and only Reason for Referral section was being
allowed.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Allow Vital Signs to use sections with entries required or section with entries optional.
		<ul>
			<li>Previously the validation was over constrained and only Vital Signs section with entries required
template was being allowed.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Allow CareTeam Members to be documented as part of either ÒEncompassingEncounter/responsiblePartyÓ
or ÒEncompassingEncounter/encounterParticipantÓ or ÒdocumentationOf/ServiceEvent/PerformerÓ.
		<ul>
			<li>Previously the validation was looking for all three of them to exist and declaring an error
incorrectly on valid samples.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Cognitive Status Problem Observation Entry was modeled with incorrect cardinality resulting in an error.
		<ul>
			<li>Previously the Problem Observation Entry was modeled with a cardinality of 1..* instead of 0..*
which was resulting in an error.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Fixed a memory leak that was causing heap exhaustion in about 4 hours.
	<li>Pregnancy Observation was modeled with incorrect cardinality resulting in an error.
		<ul>
			<li>Previously Pregnancy Observation was modeled with a cardinality of 1..1 instead of 0..1 which
caused a validation error for valid samples.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>EncounterActivities\Code vocabulary constraints were modeled incorrectly resulting in an error.
		<ul>
			<li>Previously Encounter Activities \ Code was being validated to have a code system of SNOMED-
CT or ICD-10 incorrectly. This has now been corrected.
		</ul>
	</li>
  </ul>
</li>
Known issues in this release that impact users:<br />
	<ul>
		<li>No known issues
	</ul>
<li>XDM decoder was detecting directories incorrectly.  This frequently resulted 
in the message <i>Directory IHE_XDM not found</i> even when it was present.
<li>Built with shared-lib version 160
</ul>

<h5>Known problems</h5>
<ul>
	<li>When an XDR message is received containing a CCDA, the CCDA is validated before the response message
	is sent.  This allows the validation errors to be included in the response. Since the CCDA validation
	can take a very long time to run (sometimes over a minute) the sender (Document Source actor) can 
	timeout waiting for the SOAP response.  When using toolkit as the Document Source, it does timeout.
</ul>

<h4>142</h4>

<ul>
<li>12312 - yet another fix to assertion xpath
<li>Fixed some subtle bugs in Simulator support and MU sim.  Thanks for the heads up Paulo.

</ul>

<h5>bugs</h5>
<ul>
<li>If installed to a directory with a space character in the name (like c:\Program Files)
then many internal files will not be found.  Usually the first to be noticed 
are the schema files.

<h5>bugs</h5>



<h4>137</h4>

<ul>
<li>Last few releases were built with Java 1.6 JRE which includes a few methods
on the String class that are not present in 1.5.  Switched development environment
back to JRE 1.5 so it will run with 1.5 or 1.6.
<li>Added homeCommunityId and repositoryUniqueId processing to config
linkage to Gazelle
</ul>

<h4>136</h4>

<ul>
<li>Message Validator: validation of XDR request message checked for wrong ws:Action
<li>Inspector: added <i>Get All Versions</i> action to DocumentEntries which invokes
GetDocuments with the lid as a parameter and $MetadataLevel=2
</ul>

<h4>135</h4>

<ul>
<li>Installed correct certificate for European Connectathon
</ul>

<h4>134</h4>

<ul>
<li>Fixed handling of &lt;NoPatientid/> instruction
<li>keystore password moved to war/toolkitx/xdstest/keystores/keystore.properties
<li>Add Xdstest2_version to log.xml so it will be accepted through EVS
<li>Added GetFolderAndContents to home page
<li>Added FindFolders query to home page
<li>Added metadata contents summary to queries on home page
<li>Log file cache moved under SessionCache so it deleted at the end of a session and on
initialization
<li>Upgrade to Axis2 version 1.5.4
</ul>

<h4>133</h4>

<ul>
<li>Problem at connectathon where a user would get results back from another user. Second
symptom was getting strange stack traces instead error messages that related to real
problems.  Issue was bug in management of session variable.  This has been fixed but the
fix has broken the use of simulators.  This will be fixed in a later release.
<li>Occasionally an error is repored related to not being able to load addressing module.  This
has been tracked to a bug in Axis2 version 1.4 libraries.  Some recoding has minimized the
frequency of this error.  Future upgrade to version 1.5 will actually fix it. 
</ul>

<h4>132</h4>

<ul>
<li>Added Dashboard for connectathon
<li>Finished core of IG construction including junit tests.
<li>Added better exception management to MetadataValidator page in hopes it helps solve
the perceived hang problem
<li>Added Repository Listing tab - lists Repositories by their repositoryUniqueId
<li>Warning - since I don't yet have an IG that will fan out or route XC queries to test against, the handling of 
these queries by the toolkit is suspect.
<li>Fixed Cross Community query handling of homeCommunityId
<li>Attribute DocumentEntry.documentAvailabilty - registry simulator is not ready to process this att yet
</ul>

<h4>131</h4>

<ul>
<li>Added support for DocumentEntry.documentAvailability
<li>Bug in log scanner gave strange errors in Folder validation tool
</ul>

<h4>130</h4>

<ul>
<li>The first two tests for Metadata Update are installed and ready. The main documentation
link is 
<a href="http://ihewiki.wustl.edu/wiki/index.php/XDS_Test_Kit_2009-2010_Test_Requirements#Metadata_Update">here</a>
but in reality most of the documentation for testing the Registry is displayed in the 
Pre-Connectathon Tests tab. The extent of the Metadata Update support is just enough to support
these tests. The Stored Query updates are not yet installed.
<li>The new Registry simulator is ready for public testing. It has been tested using
all the Registry specific tests in the Pre-Connectathon Tests tab (see note below
about tests involving Patient IDs)
<li>The Simulator Control and Simulator Message View tabs are ready for public testing.
<li>Pre-Connectathon Tests tab ready for public testing. Warning - tests that manipulate
the Patient ID do not yet work.  The additional Patient ID support in the toolkit is
not ready for release.
<li>Improved error message in Message Validator on HTTP parse error.
<li>Added toolkit level config param to enable all ciphers
<li>Added basic Metadata Update/Update DocumentEntry functionality.
<li>Registry sim(Register transaction) passes all tests that do not involve multiple
Patient IDs
<li>Fixed GetDocuments tab. Now works with UUID and UID inputs
</ul>

<li>Added Registry simulator
<li>Unresolved bugs:
<ul>

</ul>
</ul>

<h4>128</h4>

<ul>
<li>Added Toolkit Configuration to user interface
<li>Added refresh button to Site/Actor Configuration panel
<li>Added back into configuration these jars: xercesImpl-2.8.1.jar, ebxmlrr-common.jar, commons-logging-1.1.jar
<li>Tested successfully on these Tomcat versions: 5.5.31, 6.0.29, 7.0.2
<li>Added Mesa Test tab
<li>Added Simulator expiration
<li>Altered filenames in LogCache so no : (colon) chars are used (illegal on Windows)
<li>Unresolved bugs:
<ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>127</h4>

<ul>
<li>Added Concepts of Operation to test kit documentation
</ul>

<h4>126</h4>

<ul>
<li>First installment of documentation on the test engine (xdstest). This
installment documents the language it self.  More examples are needed and 
new sections on Concepts of Operation and the log format are still needed.
<li>Bug fix - Really poorly formatted SOAP Headers are reported as having
null value.  Error message improved.
</ul>

<h4>125</h4>

<ul>
<li>Added more online documentation
