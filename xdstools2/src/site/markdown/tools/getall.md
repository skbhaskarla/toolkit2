# GetAll Stored Query Tool #

This tool generates a GetAll Stored Query.

The parameters to the query are controlled by the Include, Filter by, Return, and Patient ID sections of the tool.

The *Include* section controls what content is requested.

The *Filter* section controls the filters used to restrict the return set.

Finally the *Return* selection controls whether ObjectRefs or LeafClass (full metadata) is returned.  If you select
ObjectRefs you can still get to the full metadata by launching the Inspector (Inspect Results button) after the
query is run.
