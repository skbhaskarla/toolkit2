# Release Notes for release 202.1 #

Reviewed and repaired Responding Gateway tests. Several problems had crept in having to do with linkage
between tests.

Test 12318 created a new Patient ID and did not use it.  This made it very difficult to run the test since
the current patient id was used in the test.

It was impossible to create the first site using the Site/Actor Configuration tool.
