<h2><a name="gettingstarted">Getting Started</a></h2>

<p>To create a new simulator, select actor type and push 'Create Actor Simulator'.  This will create simulator
(within toolkit) and make its endpoints available in the other tools in the toolkit. Save the simulator id
for the next time you want to use it.

<p>Note that the simulator's endpoints are listed

<p>The simulator's name is show.  It can be edited. This affects how it is listed in other tools (like queries).

<p>The simulator may have options to enable or disable.  The edit box controlling an optoin takes the values 
true or false (true is enabled).

<h2><a name="simulators">Simulators</a></h2>

<p>A simulator is a lightweight implementation of an IHE actor implemented within this toolkit.
In general, simulators are private and not shared between developers. This rule can be bent
in some cases. A simulator has the following benefits (comparison is made against the 
Document Registry implementation part of the Public Registry service):
<ul>
<li>Affinity Domain configuration controlled by user (future)
<li>Private database reflecting Patient Identity Feed (future)
<li>User can delete data
</ul>

<p>Specific documentation on constructing new simulators is found 
<a href="simulator.html">here</a>.

<h2><a name="ops">Operations</a></h2>

<p>A user creates one or more simulators, uses them, then deletes them.  Administratively, simulators left
unused for 30 days are deleted automatically.

<p>This tab is used to create, edit, and delete simulators.

<h3>Basic Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>The 'Select actor type' selector and the 'Create Actor Simulator' button are used to create
a new simulator.
<li>The edit box contains a comma separated list of simulator ids.  Creating a new simulator
adds its id to this box. The 'Load Simulators' button will load the simulators whose ids
are listed in the box. Details about loaded simulators are displayed below the box.
<li>Below the box is a list of simulator configurations.  Each configuration is displayed
as a property list of name/value pairs.  Some values can be edited. 
<li>Each configuration has a set of buttons on the right:
<ul>
<li>Save - save the edits
<li>Delete - delete the simulator
</ul>  
</ul>

<h3>Endpoints</h3>

<p>The toolkit generates all the necessary Web Service endpoints for an instance of 
an actor. To do this, the toolkit must know the hostname and port where it is running.
These must be configured via the Toolkit Configuration panel which is available from the Home
menu.  You must have the admin password to edit.

<p>The important parameters are:

<ul>
<li>Toolkit_Host - the hostname where the toolkit is running
<li>Toolkit_Port - the port where the toolkit is running
</ul>

<p>Each endpoint is specific to the simulator, actor, and transaction.  The simulator
is identified by the simulator id.

<h3>More Details</h3>

New simulators, when created, update the panel by:

<ul>
<li>Adding the simulator id to the box located below the 'Create Actor Simulator' button
<li>Details of the simulator are displayed below
</ul>

<p>Simulators have the following system assigned attributes:

<ul>
<li>Simulator ID - a UUID identifying the simulator.  
<li>Simulator Type - registry, repository, responding gateway, etc
<li>Creation Time
<li>Assigned endpoints and ids (repositoryUniqueId, homeCommunityId)
</ul>

<p>Simulators have the following user editable attributes:

<ul>
<li>Name
<li>Owner
<li>Description
</ul>

<p>Of these, only Name is used by the system.

<p>Additionally, if the actor defines a named option that the toolkit supports, it will
be displayed here and can be enabled or disabled. 

<p>If these are edited, the 'Save' button will save the updates.

<p>The 'Delete' button will delete the simulator and all its data. Delete means delete, 
there is no undo.

<p>When a simulator is created, it will automatically show up on actor instance lists
in other tabs in this tool. The site name is constructed from the Name followed by a dot 
followed by the simulator type.  If you create only one actor of a type, then the 
default name is adequate.  If you create two, they will be assigned the same name.  Oops. 
Two registries using the default name will show up as Private.registry.
This is where the Name attribute is needed.  Edit this attribute to get a unique site name
for use in other tools.

<p>As you create simulators, the top edit box reflects the simulators with a comma separated list
of the simulator ids. As you delete simulators, this list is also affected. A design goal of this
toolkit is to not require any type of user registration.  It is a lot of work to build and maintain
and a pain in the neck to everyone.  With no user registration, how do we keep track
of the simulators you create?   This comma separated list of simulator ids is the record.  After
creating a collection of simulators to support a piece of your testing, copy the list to a file
on your system. Later when you need to load the same collection of simulators, copy/paste
the simulator id list back into the edit box and push the 'Load Simulators' button.

<p>When you use this panel to create a simulator, it automatically shows up on the
actor selection panels within each of the tools. When you close your session with the toolkit, go home
for the weekend, and come back on Monday, all this will have been forgotton.  How do you get your actors back?
Well, your actors did not go away. Their configuration and data are still on disk.  But the tool has
forgotton all about which ones are yours. Remember this is designed to support multiple concurrent users.  To
get your simulators back, find that file that you saved the list of simulator ids into.  Copy the id list, open
the Simulator Control panel, paste the list, and hit the 'Load Simulators' button.  Now the tool knows which
simulators to load into this session.  

<h2><a name="simdb">Simulator Database</a></h2>

<p>The simulators in this tool use no database engine so there is none to install. Instead, the simulators
use a section of the filesystem to hold data and status.  The [Toolkit Configuration] menu available on the home menu
has a property called 'Simulator_database_directory'.  An writable, empty directory must be created on the
system and its path entered as the value of this property.

<p>Each time you create a simulator it is given a unique UUID, you saw that on the Simulator Control panel.
That UUID becomes a directory name under this Simulator_database_directory directory. This directory
contains two items:
<ul>
<li>A file named simctl.ser which holds the configuration information displayed on the Simulator
Control panel
<li>A directory naming the type of actor this is: registry, repository, etc.
</ul>

<p>You will see the simctl.ser type file a lot. The .ser file type is a typical file extension for files
that contain serialized Java objects. This file (and others like it) are readable/writable by Java and are 
essentially binary files.

<p>To explain the format of the actor directory (regitry, repository etc.) I use the registry simulator
as an example.  As a refresher, a registry receives metadata in Register transactions.  This metadata is
stored and index for later query.  It also accepts a Store Query transaction to retrieve metadata. To manage
this data, the registry directory contains 3 items:
<ul>
<li>rb directory holding the contents of every Register transaction it has received
<li>reg_db.ser file, a serialized Java object collection, that is the searchable index of the registry actor.
The Stored Query implementation present in the registry actor knows how to search this index to find
DocumentEntries etc. 
<li>sq directory holding the contents of every Stored Query transactoin it has received.
</ul>

<h3>rb directory</h3>

<p>This directory contains directories, each with a timestamp for a name.  Each of these sub-directories
holds the contents of a single register transaction to the registry simulator. The sub-directories
have the this internal structure:

<ul>
<li>log.txt file - this is the output of the new message validator infrastructure. It's contents
shows the internal processing that went on when executing the register transaction. It has
no connection to the xdstest output file called log.xml.
<li>request_hdr.txt - this is the us-ascii text of the HTTP header of the request message.  
<li>request_body.bin - this is the byte array (Java byte[]) of the body of the HTTP request message.
It is saved in this format since one needs to decode the HTTP header to know what character set
is used to encode the body.
<li>response_hdr.txt - HTTP header of the response message
<li>response_body.txt - HTTP body of the response message  
<li>Registry directory - this directory contains an XML file for each metadata object submitted in 
the register transaction.  If the register transaction contained a SubmissionSet, DocumentEntry, and
HasMember Association then this directory will have 3 XML files, each holding one of these objects
and named for the id of the object.  So a DocumentEntry with id=urn:uuid:87cc729b-0530-4f40-abd3-a7d29331f227
will have the filename 87cc729b_0530_4f40_abd3_a7d29331f227.xml. 
</ul>

<h4>Significance of the directory structure</h4>

<p>Inside the registry directory, the reg_db.ser file and rb directory work together to hold the contents
of the registry.  The only record of the metadata for a DocumentEntry, for example, would be in a file
2010_10_25_16_02_46/Registry/87cc729b_0530_4f40_abd3_a7d29331f227.xml where the components of this path are the
timestamp of the message, the Registry directory which holds the registry contents of the message, and 
87cc729b_0530_4f40_abd3_a7d29331f227.xml which holds the XML form of a single registry object, a DocumentEntry
for example. The registry does not use this file structure to process Stored Queries.  Instead, it loads 
the reg_db.ser file which contains all the information about all submitted messages (register transactions) 
in a form that is easy to search.  In essense, the Document Registry actor is split into a searchable
index and a metadata repository. Kinda twists the terminology used in XDS doesn't it?

<p>To service a Stored Query, the reg_db.ser file is consulted. The requested objects are found.  If the
Stored Query request asks for ObjectRefs in return, the response message is formed just from this file.  If
LeafClass is requested, then the XML files holding the full content of the relevant objects are gathered
to build the response.

<p>Beside allowing the simulator to manage a very small index file, there is a second benefit to this design.
The individual timestamped directories (children of the rb directory), each holding the contents of a single
submission, can be individually deleted.  When a message directory is deleted, the registy index 'forgets' 
about this submission.  Users have full control over the deletion of metadata from their instance of 
a registry simulator. Deleting a message directory, deletes its HTTP message and metadata content.
When the Simulator Message View panel allows you to delete messages, it is doing just that, deleting
the directory representing the message. But, you can bypass the toolkit here and simply delete the 
directory using your favorite file system tools.  They are probably more sophisticated than anything
that will ever be built into this toolkit.

<h3>sq directory</h3>

<p>Where the rb directory held the contents of every register transaction, this directory
holds the contents of every Stored Query transaction. It contains the following files with the same
significance as those in the rb directory:

<ul>
<li>log.txt file - this is the output of the new message validator infrastructure. It's contents
shows the internal processing that went on when executing the stored query transaction. It has
no connection to the xdstest output file called log.xml.
<li>request_hdr.txt - this is the us-ascii text of the HTTP header of the request message.  
<li>request_body.bin - this is the byte array (Java byte[]) of the body of the HTTP request message.
It is saved in this format since one needs to decode the HTTP header to know what character set
is used to encode the body.
<li>response_hdr.txt - HTTP header of the response message
<li>response_body.txt - HTTP body of the response message  
</ul>
