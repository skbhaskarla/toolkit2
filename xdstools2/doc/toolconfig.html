<h1>Tool Configuration Help</h1>

<p>The toolkit has a small number of parameters that must be set after installation
to configure for the local site. This panel is used to edit these parameters.
The parameters are:

<dl>
<dt>Admin_password</dt>
<dd>This password is needed to update the actors.xml file and to access this panel
to configure the tool. When this password is changed, you must reload the 
window in the browser for the change to take effect.</dd>
<br />

<dt>External_Cache</dt>
<dd>This is a filesystem location external to the toolkit where the toolkit can store information. Being
external, it is unaffected by installing a new version of the toolkit. The value of this parameter
must be an absolute pathname of an existing, writable, empty directory. The toolkit will store 3 things here:
actors.xml file (and/or actors directory) - the default copy is internal to the toolkit.  Any edits you make are stored here; 
TestLogCache directory - for storage of Mesa test log files (log.xml); and the directory simdb
were simulators store state.
</dd>
<br />

<dt>Toolkit_Host and Toolkit_Port</dt>
<dd>These will be used with the simulator system. Not used at the moment.</dd>
<br />

<dt>Enable_all_ciphers</dt>
<dd>By default the TLS environment only enables two encyption cyphers, one Windows 
friendly and one Linux Friendly.  When set to true, all cyphers available to the
Java run time environment are allowed.</dd>
<br />

<dt>Use_Actors_File</dt>
<dd>When true, the actors.xml file which is stored in the External Cache (see above) is used
to hold the actor configurations.  Each system is represented by an XML Site element
in the file. When false, the actors directory (in the External Cache directory)is used instead.  
In this mode,
each XML Site element is housed in its own file named by the site name (.xml). This second mode is required
when configurations are being downloaded from Gazelle (Gazelle_Config_URL not emtpy).</dd>
<br />

<dt>Gazelle_Config_URL</dt>
<dd>When not empty, this is the REST URL for Gazelle to be used to update
the actors directory.  This overrides the setting for Use_Actors_File forcing
the use of the directory form for Site config storage. When this parameter
is empty, the Gazelle linkage is disabled and the Use_Actors_File
setting is heeded.</dd>
<br />
</dl>
