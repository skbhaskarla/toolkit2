# Release Notes for release 2.202.9 #

FIXED - [Issue 94](https://bitbucket.org/iheos/toolkit2/issues/94) - 
On startup all simulator configs are scanned and if host:port do not match current toolkit.properties 
config they are updated. See [How To](../howto/movesim.html) for details.

FIXED - [Issue 96](https://bitbucket.org/iheos/toolkit2/issues/96) - 
Simulator endpoints included double slash after port numbers. This was introduced in the previous release 
when servlet context was added to endpoint builder so that endpoints tracked the current installation context for toolkit.
